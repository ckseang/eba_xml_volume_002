                <p><title> Cairo - Egypt. Dec. 7. 1892.</title></p>
                Sailed from New York in S.S. Fürst Bismarck on
            Thursday, Nov. 17th bound for Naples, - Mr. and Mrs. Davis - Nettie Buttles - with
            Howard Amory - and the faithful Jones. We had brilliant weather and smooth sea, with the
            exception of one day and night when we rolled tremendously. The ship [sic; is]
            admirable. It was her first voyage in these southern waters. We had only about 120 first
            class passengers in all that big ship - but a most noisy and unattractive lot. The only
            ones we could fraternize with were Mrs. and Miss Bronson of New York - and Mrs. Ledyard
            of Newport, with her daughter Mrs. Spencer Ledyard formerly Mrs. Fred Newbold. We
            carried over 900 steerage passengers - all Italians - going back, most of them to spend
            the winter in Italy. Nettie who has been very ill, and hardly able to sit up when first
            brought on board, improved with every moment, was never ill, and beamed with pleasure
            the whole day. The Bismarck has a hurricane deck forward - a most delightful nest among
            the smoke stacks and great ventilators - and we had it generally quite to ourselves.
            Reached Gibraltar on the morning of the 25th Friday, at 7 o’clock - and we were up,
            Nettie and I, to see the approach to the great Rock, which was beautiful in that early
            dawn, with a mass of rose coloured cloud about its head - the blue water crisp with the
            fresh breeze, and the many little boats that put out to us gay with their colours and
            cargoes Page 2 of fruit and flowers. Dropped our anchor for 2 hours, and sent three
            passengers ashore - and Howard went ashore with Mrs. Spencer Ledyard and a young British
            diplomat, who had come out to meet her. Then we had again lovely weather and smooth
            sailing to Genoa, where we reached the dock on Sunday morning at 7:30. A cold bitter
            wind was blowing - the first touch of anything like winter we have had. Here Mrs.
            Bronson and her daughter left us, going to Florence for the winter. In a few hours we
            were off again for Naples, and on 12 o’clock on Monday 29, were at anchor in the bay,
            with Vesuvius just before us - looking more splendid and dignified in his unbroken
            sloping lines than I had ever seen him, with just a suspicion of smoke at his summit. It
            was beautiful entering that unrivalled bay in that big steamer and from the vantage
            ground of the hurricane deck - and it was touching to see the delight of our Italians as
            they recognized first one and then another familiar thing. We went to the Grand Hotel
            for the night, and were off the next afternoon at 4 o’clock on the Hydaspes - one of the
            small P. &amp; O. steamers, for Alexandria. It was cold in Naples, so that fires were
            necessary in our rooms - it was still colder on the water, and the walls of the ship
            were ventilated in the manner of eastern steamships, so that it was impossible to avoid
            draughts, and of course I promptly took cold. The decks were very pleasant - and what a
            delightful exchange in the way of fellow passengers, from those of the Bismarck. One of
            my neighbors at table was very interesting - a Mr. Tylor - going out to Egypt to
            excavate at El Kab - had been a great deal in America - and was very jolly - but with a
            heavy Page 3 cold - and a suggestive cough. Reached Alexandria at 7 o’clock on Saturday
            Dec. 3. Nettie and Howard all eyes for the strange people and their ways. We lunched at
            the Khedival, having of course been detained too long at the Custom House to catch the 9
            o’clock train to Cairo - where we did not arrive until 8:30 in the evening. As the train
            pulled in the station I recognized our dear Mahommed Salah waiting for us, with our old
            cook Hanna Ibraim - and they gave us warmest greetings. We came to Shepheards, which has
            been greatly enlarged and improved since we were here - the big hall done in Egyptian
            architecture style, at which it is the fashion to laugh - and I greatly loathe the
            arabesque furniture and fittings of most of the rooms. We have quite a row of pleasant
            rooms, bringing up with a big sitting room in the corner - all of them look out upon the
            large garden of the hotel, with overhanging balconies - and from the window of the
            sitting room where I am writing I see a lovely vista of palms and stately lubbek trees
            and tropical shrubs, among which the big gray and black crows are always flying and
            croaking. The grass is very good too, and several Arabs are always sprinkling it and
            pushing about the lawn mower, which looks strange in such hands - and I like to watch
            the gray bearded old Mohammedan who keeps the gate just below us - sitting for hours
            leaning against his little gate house, with his goolah of water by his side.
            Occasionally he takes a drink from this, or admits some one who stops to chat with him,
            or spreads his rug and says his prayers. He wears coarse stockings and red shoes - a
            dignity to which he has not long been accustomed, or to which he has not yet Page 4
            comfortably adapted himself, for he wrestles much of the time with them - puts the red
            shoes side by side in front of him, and loses himself in contemplation of them - takes
            off the stockings - scratches his legs - and then resigns himself to the comfort of
            natural bare feet - until he hears someone approaching and scrambles back into the
            livery of civilization. We pay the penalty of having rooms looking to the garden by
            having them invaded by hordes of mosquitoes. I have been out of the house but once - on
            Sunday morning when I drove down with Theodore and Nettie to see our dahabeah, the
            Herodotus, which Mohammed has had engaged for us for months, and which is now in
            complete sailing readiness. We were much pleased with the boat - she is 18 ft. broad and
            105 in length and carries 12 sailors beside the Captain, 2d Captain, and the Captain’s
            son - a boy of 15, who serves as deck cook for the men. Nettie was in raptures with it
            all, as indeed she is with everything. Some pleasant people who crossed with us in the
            Hydaspes are sitting opposite us at table here - Sir George Macpherson-Grant and his
            family. My cold was so bad for two days that I have not been down stairs - and go from
            my own room where I have a lamp burning all day to keep up the temperature, to the
            sitting room which is warmed all day by the sun. As some sort of a compensation I have
            pleasant daily visits from Dr. Sandwith - while the rest are out all day, seeing the
            sights of this beautiful Cairo. Page 5 Third Sunday in Advent. Dec. 11th. I have had a
            dull week - but am better - walked out on Friday, and yesterday drove out - went with
            Mohammed to get some plants for the boat. This morning when Howard came home from church
            I walked down the street with him to a confectioners and bought a lot of Xmas things for
            the sailors. Theodore reports Mr. Tylor as having started up the river in the Kitty, the
            same little boat that Mr. Chester used to have, and that kept us company for so many
            weeks on the river two years ago. Mr. Peto too, another Hydaspes acquaintance is now
            looking about for a small dahabeah, but has found nothing yet to suit his fastidious
            taste. We start up the river ourselves tomorrow, provided there is any wind. Mohammed
            has everything ready. The contracts have been considered and reconsidered - and formally
            signed. Theodore pays Rostivitete Bey the owner of the boat £120 each for the first and
            second months and £100 for the third month - and £3. a day after the third month.
            Mohammed furnishes the cook and 2 men servants and our living (for 6 people) for £5.10 a
            day. I am full of delight to be once more starting up the Nile. Dahabeah “Herodotus”.
            Dec. 14th We came on board Monday morning, Dec. 12th and settled ourselves with much
            delight in our pleasant and commodious quarters. We quite filled the big omnibus from
            Shepheards with ourselves and our bags and rugs. The boat was lying just above the
            bridge on the Cairo side, and it was easy to reach her. The day was a quiet one, but
            Page 6 early in the afternoon the sailors polled us out in the stream, and about 4
            o’clock our Rais taking advantage of a little wind, started, and we made a very slow
            progress of about 5 miles, pulling up at sunset for the night. As we left our landing
            place, one of Cook’s dahabeahs, the “Ammon Ra” flying the American flag, pulled under
            the bridge and took our place. We have been busy settling ourselves. Mrs. Davis and I
            have opposite rooms next the cabin - quite large with excellent beds, and sofas -
            washstands with running water - mirrors - lockers - book racks and easy chairs - two
            windows in each room - Nettie is next me in a room not so large as mine, and Howard
            opposite her. Then come Jones and the bath room opposite each other, and the stairway to
            the deck - and then the big stern room, with its outside balcony, which is Theodore’s,
            and is most comfortable and pleasant. Our big upper deck, which is really a sitting room
            is charming with its rugs, easy chairs, divans and tables. The cabin is large enough not
            to seem crowded with Nettie’s piano - and looks most homelike. Yesterday was absolutely
            quiet - the water like glass, & very warm. We had an awning stretched over the deck, and
            we polled and drifted in the face of the strong current, all day - until we gave it up
            in the afternoon, and anchored, having made hardly more than a mile, and still having
            the Citadel in view. This morning we made an early start - passed Bedrechein soon after
            breakfast - a fair wind, increasing in the afternoon to strong - the succession of
            pyramids before us all day long. How strange those great things always are! and seen
            from a distance how they dominate the land, and make plain their enormous size. Page 7 A
            very great contrast this opening journey is, to the one we made 2 years ago, when we
            started out with a rattling cold wind, that carried us up to Benisoef the second day.
            Made 40 miles today. Dec. 15th. We have made a fair run of 30 miles today - and passed
            this afternoon the very pleasant looking Gov. dahabeah, the “Miriam”, with Mr. de
            Morgan, now Superintendent of the Ghizeh Museum, on board with a party of friends. The
            day has been delicious - very warm - and I bask in the dry, pure, sweet air from the
            desert, finding it entrancing. We are lying tonight a few miles below Benisoef. I have
            been looking through a window at the starlit night - no moon - but stars so intensely
            brilliant - Orion superb - but in a most unusual position to my northern eyes. Dec.
            16th. An excellent run today of about 51 miles - to where we are now lying somewhere
            near Golosseneh. The wind has been very strong at times - and the current so strong,
            caused by the very high Nile of this year, and such numbers of working boats, that it
            has made the sailing very exciting. How effective these great winged sails of the boat
            are! Looking behind us again and again to-day, it was like a flock of great white birds
            coming after us. It is now past 10 o’clock. Nettie, Howard and I are writing at the
            table in our large pretty, well Page 8 lighted cabin. Theodore is reading Petrie’s “Ten
            years digging in Egypt”. I have just been to the door opening on the lower deck, to look
            at the ever strange night scene. The sailors are all wrapped in their blankets lying
            asleep on the floor. Mahommed and our Rais, with innumerable shawls wrapped about their
            heads, sitting on the floor crooning together - and on the shore the bright fire of the
            “watcher man” as Mohammed calls them - who are paid for guarding us through the dangers
            of the night, and who invariably do it by sleeping soundly. Dec. 17th. We laid at our
            resting place of last night near Golossaneh until about 11 o’clock - waiting for a
            breeze. A delicious morning - air fresh and sun bright - we went ashore after breakfast
            and walked up and down on the hard level black mud. The usual Egyptian village of mud
            houses embowered in palm trees was near us, and over the stretch of freshly ploughed
            ground that lay between, and into which, men were busy transplanting onions, a thing I
            had never seen done, came a string of children and fellaheen to stare at us, and to lie
            in wait for possible backsheesh. The first one I met, was a little mother, looking
            hardly more than a child herself, with a really sweet, clean baby - almost naked -
            indeed its only dress was a spare corner of its mother’s garment, such a very little red
            bronzy baby it was, with perfectly rounded plump legs and feet - its little round brown
            head covered with the blackest hair, and its sleepy eyes when it opened them, as big and
            softly black Page 9 as its little mother’s. When she opened her dress and showed me this
            baby curled up in her arm, I was strongly tempted to take it in mine. Then came dozens
            of others, until I think the village had disgorged itself of all its babies - but none
            at all so nice as my first brown little mannikin. I wanted to photograph some of them,
            and sent Jones to the boat for my camera, but as soon as I had placed the tripod, half
            of the crowd took to its heels, but was finally lured back by Mohammed producing several
            oranges. Many of the people were much tattooed. I succeeded in getting two or three
            groups. I should liked to have photographed a group I saw in the distance through my
            glass, swinging along the walls of the town under the palm trees - first an Egyptian gen
            d’armes in his European dress, with red fez, then 3 arabs chained and handcuffed
            together, followed by two or three dignified turbaned officials. The wind came at last,
            but rather fitfully and in strong gusts - which made the sailing very exciting - we ran
            at times close to green fields, and the delicious scent of the scent trees was brought
            to us - with a general fresh spring like fragrance of all things growing - and the larks
            song - and the beautiful hoopoo birds showed themselves - and we passed lovely stretches
            of sand and desert lying up against the great limestone cliffs - little Coptic churches
            with their white domes showing in desolate places, with a fringe of palm and scent
            trees. Passed the cliffs of Gebel et Ter, or mountain of the bird, with the Coptic
            Convent of Our Lady the Virgin, lying on its lofty plateau, looking poor and desolate
            against the sky line, and apparently hardly more than a collection of abject huts. We
            stopped at sunset - having Page 10 made only 18 miles, and are now about 10 miles from
            Minyeh. The day after we started from Cairo, Mohammed produced a wretched little gray
            and white kitten, which he said he thought I might like - we found her swarming with
            fleas, and Jones valiantly offered to wash her - and a frightened, scrambling,
            scratching cat is no joke of a thing to wash. We gave her a bath of strong carbolic soap
            and water and after she was dried, and had regained her contours, she was very pretty -
            and she is gradually growing tame and at home. I have been busy for two days making
            curtains and lounge coverings for my room, out of some cheap pink and white chintz I
            bought in Cairo - and now the little room is very fresh and dainty - I could not live
            peaceably with the dark blue and orange and tinsel Turkish stuff, that I displaced. Dec.
            18th. 4th Sunday in Advent. Before I was dressed this morning, we were under way with a
            good breeze which increased to such violence, that rapid sailing seemed dangerous. Still
            we kept on. I found it too windy on deck, and have been below a good deal. Passed
            Miniyeh soon after breakfast. Referring to my diary of 2 winters ago on the river, I see
            that we reached Minyeh on the 3rd day of the voyage - and we are now on our 7th day! We
            pulled up at last, about 11 o’clock, under a bank shaded by palms and scent trees - near
            a small dahabeah flying the English flag - the Manhatta - with Lord somebody Bentinck
            and family on board, her dragoman told Salah they were 18 days from Cairo! We all got
            off, and took a lovely walk into the country back of the river. We lay here Page 11 all
            the afternoon, and are still here - the wind being too strong to sail. We have not
            looked very much like Sunday today. For some days we have had some suspicions of the
            hold of our boat - and I declared at last that I heard water under the boards - so they
            were taken up, and to our consternation we found several inches of water on the iron
            bottom - all the men were set to work, and constant bailing went on until all was clean
            and once more dry, when Jones went under and thought he discovered the leak in the pipe
            leading from the bathtub. We will be able to tell tomorrow. Anything else might prove a
            serious thing. We have made 22 miles, and have been joined by one of Cook’s Postal
            boats, which lies just behind us. Dec. 19th. We left our mooring place of last night
            about 9 o’clock - passed the Beni-Hassan landing place, reserving that for our downward
            journey - passed Rhodah, nearly opposite which are the ruins of Antinoë, where Antinous
            is said to have drowned himself, and where Hadrian afterwards built a town, hardly
            anything now remaining of its ruins, though important remains were seen by the French
            Expedition. Some miles further on, still on the east side of the river, we pass Der
            en-Rakbeh the “convent of the date palms” - near which is the important tomb with the
            celebrated representation of the transportation of a Colossus - so well know from the
            print in Wilkinson. This we hope to see on our way down. Then we pass Tell el-Amarnah,
            with the famous grotto tombs, where not long since the grave of Khu-en-aten (Amenophis
            IV) the sun Page 12 worshipper was discovered, and the equally famous Tel el-Amarnah
            tablets, now in the British Museum, of such great historical value. The day was cold and
            windy, and I spent most of my time below, very busy with my writing and work. Early in
            the afternoon we passed the Wilbur dahabeah, and the Gazelle with the Austrian flag.
            About 4 o’clock the wind being very violent, and approaching the great chain of the
            Gebel Aboufeydah on the east bank, where the river makes two or three great bends, and
            is the most difficult piece of navigation between Cairo and Assouan, we took refuge to
            some lofty cliffs, and tied up for the night. It was most exciting seeing our sailors
            climbing up our big boom to furl the sail, in the howling wind. Soon after we stopped,
            the English dahabeah Manhatta came up behind and stopped, and in a few moments was
            followed by the Gazelle, which took a position just ahead of us. Everybody went for a
            walk - met the Bentincks who stopped to talk. Climbed the cliff a little way to look at
            some empty tombs, and tried to get in the gate of a little Coptic mosque, with no
            success - saw some fine Dom palms, and our men got us some of the nuts. Coming back, it
            was such a pretty sight - the three boats lying against that desolate shore, a long low
            island covered with shrubs shutting us off on the other side from the broad, shallow
            channel of the river - the beautiful clear sunset colors giving such an air of peace to
            everything. Coming on board, it looked so comfortable to see the men wrapped in their
            shawls after their hard day, and crooning about their little deck stove - I hope they
            feel half as comfortable as they looked. Much visiting in the evening between Page 13
            the different crews - and three groups of guards with their fires, on shore. Made 41
            miles. The ground near us is green with the young wheat, 5 and 6 inches high. Dec. 20th.
            Before getting up this morning, I lay looking at the mists rolling off the river,
            curling themselves into fantastic shapes as the sun gradually dried and scattered them.
            There are sliding outside shutters to the windows, and one the sailors is always sent
            around the boat in the morning, walking along the outside ridge, to open them, and it is
            a lazy pleasure to lie in bed and watch the outside world. We are lying this evening
            within 10 miles of Assiout. We have been all day passing the Aboufoydah chain - and the
            Nile makes many great bends below Assiut, and it is often very tiresome and troublesome
            getting along here. The Austrian and English dahabeahs have been near us all day - and
            when the wind fell quite light in the afternoon, the Gazelle being smaller and lighter
            than we are overtook us just as we drew to our landing place. We have made 27 miles
            today - it has been rather cold, and I have been down stairs most of the day, busy with
            my letters for the mail tomorrow. Dec. 21st. After breakfast this morning, we went on
            deck to see the minarets of Assiut, which we hoped to reach very early - but the wind
            failed, and it was not until after 12 o’clock, that we drew to the Page 14 landing - the
            Gazelle having gone in just before us. The usual scenes took place - amusing to Theodore
            and me, and wildly exciting to the rest, who had never witnessed anything of the kind -
            the gathering of the donkeys, and donkey boys and men - the mad rush for our saddles
            when they were brought up - the shrieks and yowls - the blows and kicks from the gens
            d’armes - and then after the donkeys had been chosen, sudden peace! After lunch was
            over, we waited until half past 2 o’clock the sun was [sic; not] so hot, before starting
            for the town. It was delightful to be riding along again in these well remembered
            scenes. I had a charming donkey, “name he Telephone”, as my donkey boy informed me. We
            went first to the Post Office, but finding it closed, kept on to the town and bazaar,
            where we bought ammonia, and Persian Insect powder, and Carbolic Acid, and wire, and a
            crochet needle! Then we rode about in a general way, stopping at a large garden where I
            had been before, and got some sprays of Bougainvillia, then brought up again at the P.O.
            where we deposited our 21 letters and brought away a huge mail of letters and papers,
            which occupied us all the evening. Dec. 22. Left Assiut this morning - day hot and
            still. Have made only 5 miles. We had quite an excitement last night. Theodore, Nettie
            and I were the last ones up - after I had entered my room and lighted my candles, I saw
            a most disgusting and horrible monster on the mosquito netting - to my excited
            imagination he looked a foot or more in length, Page 15 with 2 enormously long antennae,
            which as he waved them at me, threw their shadow on the wall in a ludicrously
            exaggerated manner. I went to Theodore and Nettie for assistance, and we tried to bag
            the creature with no success - he dropped on the bed, ran behind it and disappeared -
            and although we pulled everything to pieces, we could not find him. So Theodore nobly
            proposed that I should occupy his room, and he would take mine, and brave the danger of
            the reappearance of the beast. I was base enough to accept, and gladly went to the big
            stern room for the night. This morning on telling Salah about it at breakfast, he
            protested that it should be looked into at once, and soon had the men in the room - bed
            taken to pieces, drawers taken out from underneath, and Jones putting a candle in and
            then his hand, declared he saw the monster as “long as his foot”, and with a towel
            grabbed him and brought him out. He really proved to be about 3 inches long, and to my
            great relief I saw that he was a flying insect, and did not reside on the boat with his
            uncles, aunts and cousins. Jones put him under a glass, and treated him to large doses
            of Persian powder, and intends carrying him home as a specimen of Egyptian game. However
            everything in the dahabeah was turned out, this morning - floors washed with hot water -
            carpets shaked and brushed, and my room treated to doses of Carbolic acid, and plentiful
            sprinklings of Persian powder - and we hope never to see a thing of that kind again. The
            water has been like glass today - the men have tracked a little - and we laid a long
            time near a field through which the clover crop was springing - and had firm ground near
            the water for quite a walk. Page 16 Dec. 23d. Two miles today, with so much exertion, we
            gave it up - I am impressed again with the almost level and unbroken mountain chain
            following the bank on the eastern side, from Cairo - the great limestone cliffs making
            an almost unbroken sky line - and their colors so soft - and their shadows so pink and
            gray - we pass great bends in the river, and then seem to come back to the identical
            cliffs. Dec. 24th. We have made 8 miles today and have passed Aboutig. The men have been
            getting palm branches and sugar canes for tomorrow’s decoration. Dec. 25th. Christmas
            Day. When I went into the cabin this morning to arrange some modest little gifts about
            the table, I found Salah had been busy with his decorations, and the cook had sent in
            all the wonderful dishes he had prepared in honor of the day. A large pyramid of nougat
            in the form of a Greek temple was in the centre of the table, with artificial roses and
            a pink cupid inside the temple! two pyramids of cakes overlaid with coloured icing and
            bonbons, flanked the temple - and dishes of brilliant candies and bonbons were grouped
            about. A mass of roses and fragrant white jasmine was really lovely - around the room
            were other flowers, and branches of oranges and mandarins in their own green leaves were
            hung - Salah was delighted as the faithful Page 17 fellow always is, with our
            approbation. I had bought in Cairo, a lot of pictured horns of plenty filled with candy,
            and tied with pretty ribbons for the sailors, and some more pretentious bonbonières for
            the other men, and Xmas cards for all. After we had finished breakfast, we went out to
            the lower deck, and I gave them about, Theodore supplementing them with a gift of money
            to each. Their delight was so childish, it was quite pathetic - and during the day I saw
            one and then another examining this [sic; his] treasures, and treating himself to a bit
            of candy. Of course our gifts to our magnificent Salah (as we generally call Mohammed,
            there being so many other Mohammeds on the boat) were quite apart from all the rest. It
            was not easy to think that this was Christmas, whatever it might be at home and in
            northern lands - and last night we could repeat Tennyson’s couplet and say, “We live
            within the strangers land, and strangely falls our Xmas eve”. When about 9 o’clock I
            took my little weather observation the thermometer stood at 58°! A pleasant surprise
            when we went on deck was the beautiful decoration - palm branches and masses of the
            sorghum or sugar cane, the latter will serve the further purpose of supplying the men
            with their favorite sweet, for all Egyptians love to suck the sugar cane, which is sold
            everywhere in the streets of the town, and along the roadside for that purpose. When
            night came, and we had pulled up to the bank near Gou, coloured lanterns were run up to
            both the masts, and we had fireworks - and Nettie and Howard got off some of the
            entertainments they had prepared for the men, with great success. There has been no wind
            today to speak of - and although we have made Page 18 about 10 miles, it has been done
            by tracking and polling. Pleasant as our life is here, we begin to complain that the
            wind does not blow, the good north wind that carries boats up the river. Yesterday with
            all our efforts we made only 8 miles, and the day before only 2, - such a contrast to
            our other voyage, when we reached Luxor on the 14th day of our voyage - and today we are
            only within 38 miles of Sohag, and 171 from Luxor. The weather is very different too -
            then it was cold and often cloudy - now it is like our June weather at Newport - and
            only in the early morning is it sometimes cloudy - yet though the progress has been
            slow, the hours have been to me so full of quiet beauty, that they have gone only too
            fast. The beauty of the noonday is something exquisite - I revel in it - and the air of
            the desert is so pure, so soft and fresh - so lifegiving. I have picture after picture
            in my mind of low, sandy shores, with stretches of green, and the soft yellow of the
            limestone cliffs beyond - and fringes of palm trees, and graceful masses of soft
            fragrant scent trees - and strange low villages of mud hovels - with shrouded figures
            moving about or huddled against the walls - and distant noises of voices - of barking of
            dogs - and through it all we slip mysteriously along, to the music of the soft ripple of
            the water - through the intense hot noon day, or the brilliant evening. Dec. 26. Another
            quiet day without wind. Gazelle close to us - sometimes in advance - sometimes behind -
            it becomes almost embarrassing Page 19 to pass so often and so close. It is some
            Austrian nobleman, with his wife, governess and child - and he is always playing chess
            on the upper deck. We have been passing the lofty cliffs of Sheikh el-Hereedeh coming
            sometimes close to the river - have made 6 miles, and after hoping all day to make
            Sohag, we are still several miles away. Dec. 27. Passed Sohag this morning soon after
            breakfast in a good wind and seeing the Bazelle [sic; Gazelle] had stopped there, we
            hoped we had shaken her off at last - but alas! in the difficult bend of the river
            between Sohag and Akmin, we came to grief on a sand bank where we stayed an hour and she
            sailed past us again. The town of Akmim was a most interesting place as we sailed past
            it - and has some special points of interest to lovers of antiquity - and we have
            resolved to stop there on our way down. We had a splendid wind the rest of the day - we
            could see the Gazelle in the distance, and a small dahabeah which we take to be the
            Kitty. Pulled up at Girgeh soon after 6 o’clock - and will stay here until day after
            tomorrow to bake bread. It is vexing to stop so long where there is nothing to be seen.
            There is always a strife between the Captains and the owners of the dahabeahs, in this
            matter of baking bread. The former have a preference for certain places, and declare it
            can be baked nowhere else. Our best sailing day for sometime - have made 31 miles. Page
            20 Dec. 28th. We are lying by a low sand island with quite a little stream between it
            and the busy landing place - so that we are separated from its noise and dirt, and yet
            can see the stream of travel up and down the path on the bank. Girgeh has a very pretty
            effect with its tall minarets, and the great cliffs of the Arabian mountains opposite.
            It is an important town of nearly 15,000 inhabitants - a large proportion of which are
            Copts - and the name is Christian, from “Girgis” the Captain of St. George who is their
            patron saint. When we were here before I remember going through the bazaar, and seeing
            an interesting fair, and being allowed to look into an old Mosque with lovely Saracenic
            tiles. The rest went off quite early in the felucca to do the town - and I not feeling
            up to it stayed at home all day reading and working, finding the shaded deck a charming
            resting place, with all the many interesting things going on outside. Salah has been
            doing a tremendous shopping in the way of live stock - and it was entertaining to see
            the boats arriving with sheep and chicken and pigeons and turkeys. At last, our little
            island looked like a veritable farm yard, with two wooly black sheep nibbling at a heap
            of green stuff, and innumerable fowls picketed about, and one of the amusements of the
            day was to see a thin old cantankerous cock, with an equally gaunt old brown hen, and
            another plump little gray hen very much snubbed and kept in order by the old brown hen,
            who had established themselves near the gangway, and who I think were the sole survivors
            of the large family we had brought from Cairo - and of Page 21 course were entitled to
            certain airs of possession. But it was killing to see the state of mind the old cock was
            in as the other fowls began to arrive - he grew more and more furious as two or three
            other cocks began to wander about, and the brown hen had to bring him home again and
            again after his furious excursions. Indeed she was most faithful to him in every way,
            and did not at all countenance his bland exception of any of the strange young hens, but
            hustled them off the scene quite as ferociously as she helped him fight his cocks. At
            last after a family of 5 turkeys had been introduced to the island, and began strutting
            about he could be restrained no longer - fight after fight occurred - the valiant old
            fellow sallying out again and again to the conflict with the five - he was simply picked
            out of the contest time and time again, and was a most battered old fellow with one eye
            shut up and feathers gone, and a man had to be hired to watch him and keep the peace
            until the coops were ready and he was shut away from his enemies. In the afternoon
            Theodore stayed at home with me and we had tea on deck, and tonight every thing is
            ready, and all hoping for a good wind tomorrow. The bread all baked, and ready to be cut
            and dried. Dec. 29th. To our dismay this morning a strong south wind was blowing, and we
            made no pretense of getting away until after 2 o’clock in the afternoon - and with a
            little wind and much tracking we made Balliana 8 miles away, at 7 o’clock this evening.
            Cook’s steamer, and 2 daha Page 22 beahs near us - one the Kitty. For two or three days
            we have been in the pigeon country - the houses with their pigeon towers, looking like
            strange fortresses and pylons - and altogether strangely picturesque. But these are not
            the pigeons for eating, but are kept for their valuable manure, which collected and
            dried forms the chief fuel. Dec. 30th. The weather being so quiet this morning, we
            devoted the day to Abydos - Nettie in some trepidation committing herself for the first
            time to a donkey. The paths and towns looked so familiar - first along the river bank,
            then through the towns and out across part of the Libyan desert - but charming as it
            was, it was not so pretty as the last time we did it, as we now are so much earlier, and
            the crops not so far advanced. I remember them as being quite as high as our donkeys -
            Nettie was full of delight over her first temple - and it seemed far more wonderful to
            me than ever - its beautiful colours, its exquisitely cut reliefs - the famous picture
            of Seti Ist, its splendid columns. We lunched sumptuously in the hypostyle hall - and
            afterwards encountered Mr. Tylor looking miserably ill. He introduced his friend Mr.
            Somers-Clarke, particularly interested in Coptic things - an extremely pleasant fellow,
            and after dinner this evening, they came over and made us a long visit. Mr. Tylor has
            been in America and seems to know everyone - has visited the John Bancrofts in Boston.
            The ride back to the boat in the heat of the afternoon was very tiring - my donkey was
            poor, and my saddle too big - Nettie was so overcome with Page 23 fatigue, that we had
            to stop and rest her. Dec. 31st. Calm and hot - our sailors tracked for 6 or 7 miles -
            early in the afternoon we pulled up discouraged - the Kitty just behind us- and Mr.
            Tylor and Sommers-Clarke came over for awhile, and we all went for a stroll.- Cloudy all
            day. Jan. 1st. Utterly quiet weather - the atmosphere as motionless as the water - and,
            by tracking about 5 miles - overcast the whole day, and a few drops of rain fell in the
            afternoon. Jan. 2d. Again a quiet day, and very warm. The thermometer which hangs in the
            shade on the little balcony outside Theodore’s room, but which gets a little warmth from
            the reflection from the water, stood at 10 o’clock this morning at 72°. Tracking for 4
            miles brought us about sundown within 4 miles of Farshoot, and we drew up with the Kitty
            beside us at the head of a beautifully luxuriant valley on the west side, the great
            cliffs on the east side coming quite to the river, and reflecting the sunset glow in
            most etherially delicate tones in pink and yellow, with the shadows in ashes of roses
            colour. We had a walk under the palms, and scent trees - with their little puffy balls
            of fragrant yellow flowers - and many dôm palms - a beautiful crop of the flat pea, Page
            24 which they call gulbân growing under them, with its violet coloured blossom. After we
            got back to the boat there was such wonderful beauty abroad, that we could hardly tear
            ourselves from the deck, to go down and make ourselves ready for dinner. Over the cliffs
            opposite, the pink afterglow of the sunset began to give place to a clear white
            radiance, and soon the full moon sailed majestically up, making a magical beauty. Jan.
            3. Very hot - and no wind - thermometer at noon 79°. Referring to this date in my diary
            of 2 years ago, I find that at 8 o’clock in the morning, it stood at 45°! We tracked
            along to Forshoot, which we passed at noon. The chief feature of the place is the large
            sugar factory of the Khedive, which makes anything but a pretty spectacle, with its tall
            black chimneys and belching forth smoke - the gangs of half naked men unloading the
            sugar cane, and loading boats with bales of sugar - the cries - the shouting - the
            turmoil, the toiling men - the overseers with their sticks - the long line of big boats,
            past which our sailors laboriously carried our towing rope - was not a pleasant thing to
            see in the hot noon day. Heavens! the groans of the toiling men this ancient river has
            listened to! Mr. Tylor and Mr. Somers-Clarke spent the evening with us. Page 25 Jan. 4.
            Morning motionless - very hot - thermometer 82° - wind light in the afternoon and
            increasing - and now at 11 o’clock Salah has just come in to say to Theodore that the
            Captain is going to anchor in the stream as there are no towns near, and I went to the
            door with him, while he pointed out the loneliness of the situation - the Libyan desert
            on the right, and the Arabian on the left. What exquisite stillness there was - the soft
            lapping of the water - the brilliant stars - the tired men grouped about on their deck.
            It gave one such a feeling of comfort on coming back to the pretty brightly lighted
            saloon, to think of the wide desolation of the desert without. We passed the village of
            Hou, where lived a famous Moslim saint, who sat for 53 years naked on the bank of the
            river. Some of our sailors said prayers, and threw offerings in the river - for a
            blessing from the dead saint. At Kosr-el-Sayd the Kitty pulled up - Mr. Tylor and
            Somers-Clarke intending to visit the tombs there. I do so enjoy the delicious warmth of
            these days - never oppressive because of the entrancing air from the desert - and such
            noon days! Sitting on deck under the awnings, shielded from the intense sunlight, the
            soft intense blue of the sky, the brilliant green strip of cultivated land, and the
            delicate yellow of desert and cliff, all seem to be dissolving and palpitating in the
            opalescent air. Jan. 5. Another warm and quiet day - at 4 P.M. the thermometer stood
            Page 26 at 80°. We tracked about four miles, almost within sight of Keneh when the rope
            parted, and we waltzed out into the current, turning completely around. Such a hubbub!
            such sounding Arabic gutterals and telling gesticulations! When composure again reigned,
            we pulled to the anchor across the river, out of the dangerous current, where we are now
            lying. There have been occasional flashes of lightning during the evening - and
            growlings of thunder. Our little cat Mish-mish grows in size and favour every day - and
            is a darling - though a bit wild and savage in her play - she comes to my room often in
            the morning and demands entrance. The other night while we were sitting at dinner, I
            heard great commotion, we were sailing slowly, Salah rushed from the room, and I knew
            Mish-mish was overboard - two or three men went over after her, and found her clinging
            to the rudder - she was dried and brought to life on the kitchen range, Hanna, the cook,
            being very fond of her. Mish-mish is the Arabic for apricot, and seems to be universally
            used for cat in this country. Ours is growing fat and clean - and is no more a Cairo
            cat. Jan. 6. Last night when I went to bed, the thunder was growling in an ominous
            fashion, and I went to sleep with the soothing sound of a gentle rain in my ears. I
            heard it in the night when I awakened, and towards the morning it became harder and
            steadier. I wondered sleepily why I heard no one stirring above on deck - and thought of
            the sailors’ bread baked at Girgeh and which had been lying on the deck floor drying
            Page 27 in the sun ever since. The poor fellows were too tired from the last few days of
            hard work, polling and trucking [sic; tracking], and were too sound asleep to heed the
            rain, for no one stirred, until I heard Theodore just before it grew light prowling
            about, wakened it seems by a leak on his bed. He aroused M.S. who in turn aroused the
            crew, who began a noisy knocking about of things and mopping of the deck. There was the
            very debbil to pay as M.S. said. The skylight in the saloon had been left open as is our
            custom at night for ventilation, and the rain had run down the hanging lamp, spoiling
            the pretty blue shade with its blue ribbons that Nettie and I had made, and then
            descended upon the table beneath, where many of our books were lying, and now Baedeker,
            Budge and Mariette volumes look sadly the worse for their shower bath. Various little
            droppings, and trickling streams came through in unexpected places, for these boats are
            seldom rain proof. Fortunately we were lying at a large, low, wide spreading sand bank,
            where we still are, as a high south wind has been blowing all day, and we are waiting
            for better things - and what a spectacle we have presented today! The men turned out on
            the sand this morning all their wet clothes and blankets - hung about the boat our wet
            rugs and cushions, and we had the look of a much bedraggled carpet bazaar. The wind had
            been blowing hard from the south, and of course dead against us - and sorry as we were
            not to get on, we have had a lovely day. There is something fascinating in these
            enormous stretches of sand, hard enough to be springy and rippled over, like shallow
            water with a light wind. The air came soft, but cool and invigorating from the desert,
            the sky was gray with Page 28 heavy ominous clouds, which towards evening broke away,
            giving a gorgeous, and not at all usual Egyptian sunset. In the morning we roamed over
            the sand, sketching on its smooth surface - and actually ran races, so much did this
            life giving air of the desert intoxicate us. Our dismal men looked at us in amazement -
            and sat huddled together in all their wraps, as cheerful as fowls in rainy weather. At
            sunset Theodore and I walked to the extremest verge of this sand island, enjoying the
            stillness, and the lonely desert scene. Ah me! what delicious moments of quiet these
            are. At such times one feels the fascination of the simple nomadic life - and in any
            emergency like a failure of health, or fortune, I would much rather take up with life in
            the desert, such as I could make it, with some refinements of civilization, than with
            all the luxuries of a fashionable health resort. Thermometer 64° at 9 o’clock A.M. Jan.
            7. We started with a fair wind at 6 o’clock this morning - but at 11 o’clock it turned
            dead ahead - and our poor fellows had to take to tracking again - which they did until
            this evening, when we had a wind for an hour, and pulled up near Nagada, having made 20
            miles. We used to think that no crew could equal that of our old “Nubia” - and indeed we
            can never quite think of our present Rais with the same feeling we do of old Raid Achmed
            - and Hanna Ibrim our cook was with us also in the Nubia - but the rest of the men are
            very interesting and each one has developed a personality quite his own. The Nubians
            Page 29 all I believe possess a personal dignity and presence natural to them. One day,
            soon after leaving Cairo, when the sail was shifted in a sharp breeze, one of the men I
            had never noticed before, received a blow from the heavy rope on his head, which knocked
            off his tarboosh and scarf, and sent them into the river. He was quite angry, as it was
            the fault of one of the other men - and my attention was called to him by his fine
            dignified gesticulations, and I saw what a well made handsome fellow he was, as he stood
            wiping a little blood from his cheek and neck. I told Salah to tell him sometime that I
            would give him a new head gear and two or three days after that, as we were lying by and
            he had just come back from a walk with Nettie and Howard, he came up to the deck where I
            was sitting alone, with a bit of flowering mint in his hand, and gave it to me with a
            manner that was superb. His name is Nase - but we have dubbed him “the Haughty” - and no
            blasé worldling, of the best and most refined type, could excel him in graceful
            indifference of manner, or haughty repose. He is one of the singers of the crew - and
            seems to be the wit, for his quiet remarks at which he never laughs himself are
            frequently followed by shouts of laughter from the other men. He is the readiest fellow
            in any difficulty or emergency - can speak a few words of English, and in his clever way
            gets our meaning at once. He has me now at all times under his respectful but
            indifferent watch - and when I want anything done, Nase is generally there to do it. But
            I grieve to say that my Haughty has on one or two occasions been on a jag as Howard says
            - and Theodore is so unkind as to suggest that the noble indifference of manner is
            sometimes the Page 30 result of hashash. Then there is our second Captain, Rais Fuley
            (whom we like much better than Rais Mahommed our 1st Captain) quiet and reposeful - with
            such a presence and dignity - and a brown man who is neither handsome or magnificent,
            and who wears no shoes or stockings and whose outer garment is simply a long black or
            blue cotton robe, must have a real dignity and simplicity of character to give such
            presence. He is a very faithful Mohammedan too - is constant in his prayers - eats no
            meat - and drinks nothing but coffee and water. He is a great contrast to Rais Mohammed
            who has the most noisy and masterful ways, and when he gets excited which is often
            enough, talks more like an angry turkey gobbler than any human I have ever heard. There
            is always one sailor told off to go with each lady of the party wherever she goes.
            Nettie has a fine fellow Hassan, and I have a cheerful, clean smiling fellow, Mohammed
            Ibrahim who is a treasure. The Captain’s boy Ali, is a handsome little devil, whom we
            all like - and there is his cousin little Kamyl who is being taken to his home somewhere
            up the river, a boy of 8 years old I should think - who is the petted darling of his
            crabbed uncle, Rais Mohammed. Jan. 8th. 1st Sunday after Epiphany We started tracking at
            8 o’clock this morning - and kept it up until one o’clock - then we had a favorable wind
            until 3:30pm - then dead against us until dark. We had hoped to reach Luxor today, but
            have pulled up for the night within 4 or 5 miles of it, having made only 12 miles today.
            It has been cool all day. Page 31 Jan. 9. Luxor. With much tracking and polling,
            starting not until 10 o’clock this morning, we came along to Karnac, landing about 4
            o’clock at the Gezireh opposite - it gave us time to walk over to the great temple -
            which we did through the pleasant fields - sending Howard Jones and M.S. on donkeys to
            Luxor for the mail. We entered by the latest and great pylon - and met the very fine
            looking and friendly guide whom we well remembered. Nettie was overwhelmed with her
            first sensations - and to me it was more wonderful than ever. Here, as at Abydos, we
            noticed recent and careful repairs rather than restorations, showing the thorough
            supervision that exists now over these Egyptian monuments. When we came out of the chaos
            of ruins in the older buildings, near the sacred lake - we sat down to look about us,
            until the others arrived from Luxor, with heaps of papers and letters. I took one of the
            donkeys with the man’s saddle to ride back, while the rest walked - as we passed through
            a part of the town near the temple, a party of Busharin met us, and we stopped to look
            at their dancing - savage looking things they are with their bushy hair and black faces
            and bodies, and their white clothes - but their smiles were most friendly. Lovely
            effects going back to the river bank, under the splendid palms, and through the blooming
            crops - the cattle and sheep going home from work in the fields, or resting in groups -
            smoke curling up from the little mud houses - the voices of children and barking of dogs
            in the distance - the splendid ancient river reflecting the clear gold of the sky, and
            across, by the side of a wide sand island Page 32 or gesireh, our boat lying with its
            lights already glimmering through the windows. Jan. 10. We all crossed in the felucca to
            Karnak this morning - Theodore, Mohammed and I going on donkeys to Luxor - the rest to
            the temple. We first went to the Luxor Hotel, where is Cook’s offices, and we read the
            telegrams posted there, and the various notices, and I enquired for the pelican of past
            memory, and was told he was not living. Then we went to see our old friend Mohammed
            Mohassib, and his antiquities - nothing of special interest, except a figure in glazed
            pottery of a hippopotamus - bluish green, with figures and designs in a black tracery.
            Theodore looked very carefully at it, but we have such fear of imitations, and the old
            fellow asked £100 for it - the figure no longer than this page - so we left it and went
            into one or two other places. At the house of Todros the English Consul we saw many
            delightful things but preposterous prices asked. We heard the Osiris with the
            Macpherson-Grants had arrived from up the river. Back home again in time for lunch, and
            in the afternoon the rest wanting to go to Luxor, Theodore and I went over to Karnac
            where a donkey was waiting for me and we had a beautiful afternoon - all to ourselves
            barring our 2 sailors and donkey boys, and the pleasant guide. I have been for days
            studying the temple plans and decorations, and we had our books with us. It was lovely
            in that afternoon light. After the big temples, we went to all the outlying ones - along
            the great pylon courts to the temple Page 33 of Rameses III, and the lovely little
            temple of Khonsu, which I had never seen, as it has been quite excavated since we were
            here last, and one of its rooms was filled with excavating implements, which the guides
            told us were going to Kom Ombos. Then we went to the few scattered remains of the
            immense temple of Mont, with its battered avenues of Sphynxes, and statues of Bast - and
            desolate desert surroundings of the spot, with a wretched little encampment of Busharin
            near by, was a picture to enjoy and think about. In such a place, the present beauty of
            this wonderful old land, great as it is, is lost sight of in thoughts of its great past.
            The evidences of a mighty and finished civilization, of thousands of years of life and
            toil and ambition and suffering are overwhelming, and make the present seem very small.
            A still day - with no wind until late, from the South, and therefore not for us. Jan.
            11. This morning we pulled along our pleasant Gezireh up opposite Luxor, and so kept
            free from the noise and dirt of the town. We are lying just opposite the new Tewfikyeh
            Hotel, owned by Gage & Co. The Kitty has arrived, and we met Mr. Tylor this morning
            while we were prowling among the antiquity shops. We saw some things of undoubted value,
            some statuettes especially - one of them a stone statue of Antif - Mr. Tylor translated
            the hieroglyphics on it for us - it was about 12 inches high - the face bearing that
            noble, far away living look that is characteristic of the best period of early Egyptian
            art. Page 34 Tadros asked £120 for it and Theodore would not buy it. We hear disquieting
            rumours of a Dervish raid near Wady Halfeh - the English camel corps defeated and the
            commanding officer killed - which makes the prospect of going beyond the first Cataract
            very dubious. It would be a harrowing disappointment to me. Theodore called on the
            Grants this morning, the Osiris did not ascend the Cataract, but waited at Assouan,
            while Lady Grant and her son went up to Wady Halfa in one of the Postals with a guard of
            16 soldiers from the Assouan garrison. This was after the raid - and passengers were not
            allowed to go up for seven days following the raid. This has been another day of light
            south wind. We are now making a virtue of necessity, and as we have to wait until this
            South wind stops blowing, we are going over to the great sights among the hills - though
            we would rather push on, and leave sightseeing here until we come down with Mr. Fielding
            with us. Jan. 12. No wind today. Some of them went over to the Ramessium, Goornah,
            Medinet Haboo this morning. This afternoon we went to Karnac again, and home in time to
            receive the Grants to tea on their way home from the Tombs of the Kings. Jan. 13. We
            were over in Luxor all the morning - walking about the temple, which is being thoroughly
            excavated - the splendid papyrus Page 35 bud columns of the older temple are all shown
            now to their base. The work goes rapidly on under a crowd of workmen, and several
            railway tracks carry the little cars full of useless rubbish to the bank of the river,
            where an unceasing cloud of dust now goes up, as they are made to tumble their contents
            over. After lunch we rode out to Medinet Habou, which has also been extensively
            excavated, and where crowds of work men are busy in the vast rubbish heaps. Nettie and I
            would like to have stopped and grubbed ourselves. Another quiet day. Jan. 14. We made an
            early start for the Tombs of the Kings this morning. It was a perfect day for the
            expedition, which I had rather been dreading - much cooler than when we went before, so
            that with smoked goggles and veils, puggarees and parasols, we made the transit through
            that valley of desolation with comparative comfort. We lunched at the entrance to one of
            the unfinished tombs as soon as we arrived, and then went to the tomb of Ramses IX, then
            to that of Rameses III, commonly called Bruce’s Tomb, or the tomb of the Harpers from
            the paintings on one of the small chambers of two men playing the harp. Then to the
            greatest of all, that of Seti 1st or Belzoni’s tomb, who discovered it. More than ever
            before was I impressed by the stupendous achievement, the attempted safety and secrecy,
            so utterly futile, in the midst of such chaotic desolation as these Libyan mountains
            present. Instead of entering by the way we came, as we did before when we were here, we
            sent our donkeys on, with the exception of mine, and crossed the moun Page 36 tain over
            to Der-el-Bahri, to the temple tomb of the great Queen Hatasu, or Hatshepsu, as it is
            now the fashion to call her - the clever daughter of Thotmes Ist, the wife and sister of
            Thotmes II, and the sister and regent of Thotmes III (who built our obelisk) - I had
            never before seen this beautiful spot - and we were fascinated with it, and promised
            ourselves a longer visit there, when we came down the river. I would not, for anything,
            have missed the way over the mountain. I had much the best of it of course, on my donkey
            - the rest having to climb and walk - but I being such a light weight, was permitted to
            ride. The path led along the very edge of the cliff, and up and down various
            perpendicular places - but as the guide was leading the donkey, the donkey boy holding
            on to him behind, and one of our sailors at my side when the path was wide enough, I
            felt no responsibility and could enjoy the very extraordinary scene - except, when I
            looked down and back, at the poor toilers coming after me. Nothing I have ever seen in
            nature makes so powerful an impression, as these desert mountains - desolation and
            chaos, and not a blade of any green or growing thing. I was sorry I did not bring away
            some of the flint nodules that lie about everywhere. When we began our descent, there
            was such an entirely precipitous path, that our guide said I must dismount, and I was
            taken by each arm, and dragged or skated down over the loose rubble and sand. The view
            there, over the wide, luxuriant, verdant Theban plain, was charming, with the great
            Colossi seated in their eternal expectancy at the edge of the desert - and our ride
            home, through those fragrant fields in the late afternoon was the most beau Page 37
            tiful thing I have to remember. It was a transit through happy Elysian fields! There has
            been no wind - only little zephyrs from the south occasionally - and we begin to look
            rather serious when our friends chaff us about getting up the river this winter. We are
            to lunch with the Grants tomorrow. Jan. 15. 2d Sunday after Epiphany. This morning there
            was the usual perfect calm of water and air. The rest crossed to Luxor for church and
            walking - and Theodore came back for me, to take me to the Osiris, which lies at the
            Luxor bank. As we pulled over, the wind began to rise, and Theodore left orders with
            M.S. to have everything made ready to sail. We had a charming visit - pleasant, nice
            people. Sir George particularly, who is an unfortunate victim of gout. Lady Grant is
            good natured, loquacious, masterful, with attractive manners. Miss Grant very pretty,
            with big soft brown eyes, and that air of serene innocence that English girls have when
            they have not seen too much of the world. Young Grant, nice and intelligent, with a
            German tutor, quite one of the party. The Osiris is a fine boat - the cabin large and
            very pretty - the deck fine - but the rooms small - the double ones no larger than our
            single ones - but she has two bathrooms. The two young people lunched on the Herodotus
            with Nettie and Howard. No one waits on the Nile for ceremony when a favorable wind
            blows, and as the wind continued to hold, we hurried ourselves and came away
            immediately, we had finished lunch, passing on our way over the young Grants. In a few
            Page 38 minutes we were off in a fine, stiff wind, exchanging parting salutations with
            the people on the Osiris as we passed - but the wind proved very fitful, finally falling
            very light, and after making about 7 miles we have pulled up to the bank near Erment. We
            do not want to quarrel with our mode of life, or do anything like complaining of the
            pleasant days that fly too swiftly by, but this slow progress is growing to be a serious
            thing. Day after day M.S. says “I never see such a time on the river as this season” and
            looks very sad, seeming to feel himself responsible for this persistent quiet. We found
            one of our old sailors “Yakoub” on the Osiris. Jan. 17. Yesterday between a light wind
            and tracking we made about 28 miles, which quite encouraged us. We passed Esneh in the
            evening, and tied up just beyond, and this morning when I went on deck, Theodore had
            about decided to visit the temple, but just then a light wind sprang up, and we decided
            to sail, but the wind soon failed, and what progress we have made, about 7 miles, has
            been by tracking. The day was hot and motionless. We had a big awning up, and after
            lunch I had my little writing table carried on deck and wrote letters. A perfectly
            golden sunset - not a speck of a cloud anywhere, and not the stir of the faintest ripple
            on the golden water. It was hard to tear oneself away and go downstairs which I was made
            to do as I have not been exactly well for a day or two. Every one says - all the books
            and doctors say that the hour of sunset has danger in it - and after the heat of the
            day, Page 39 the extreme chill of the evening is very sudden. Yet no one I have ever
            met, pays the slightest attention to it - and it is the hour of the most charming beauty
            - but thick wraps must be put on, before the chill is felt. Jan. 18. I saw Esneh, when I
            went on deck after breakfast, across the great bend of the river that we had been so
            painfully getting around yesterday. There has been no wind all day until after 5 o’clock
            - our poor men tracking in the broiling sun. After that time we sailed along briskly
            until 7:30, when the night being so dark we brought up close to El Kab, having made 10
            miles. The Gazelle passed us in tow, having lost patience I suppose. One of our
            amusements is planning a dahabeah, and fitting it in the most sensible and comfortable
            way - a most fascinating diversion. It seems that they are all built in England, and
            Cooks newest dahabeahs are very pretty and luxurious, though the space is badly
            distributed. The convenient manner the men have of rolling themselves in their rugs, and
            lying down to sleep on the deck, like so many mummies, makes very narrow quarters go a
            great way with them, and if you step out of the saloon door, and look about anytime
            after 10 o’clock, it is a curious sight. While we, the pampered inhabitants of the
            interior complain if our luxurious beds are a bit uneven or hard. I never feel such a
            poor result of civilization as I do when amongst these natives, whose physical strength
            and activity seem all that nature intended. Barelegged and barefooted, with two or three
            cotton garments Page 40 about them, they stride about in the sun and wind, indifferent
            to cold and heat - while we, swathed in woolens, and tied up in a dozen restraining
            ways, shiver in the wind, and faint and sicken in the sun. Especially in the matter of
            feet, I feel our inferiority, as I note dozens of times a day that impress of their bare
            feet in the sand, or soft moist mud - the lines of the foot so straight and natural -
            the freedom of the toes, and their clinging, grasping power - the great toe apart and
            individual like a thumb - I declare there is quite as much difference between our
            cramped and distorted feet and theirs, as between the unnatural Chinese feet and ours!
            Jan. 19. We are lying at Edfou tonight - 13-1/2 miles from El Kab - which we have made
            by much tracking and a very little sailing after 5 o’clock, when a fair wind sprang up
            and lasted about 2 hours. We landed before sunset at a lovely bank of palms, a mile or
            so above the town. The rest got off for a walk but I declined climbing the steep bank,
            and was enjoying a walk up and down the deck, when Howard came hurrying back to say I
            must come, that they had struck a Busharin settlement, and that a wedding was going on.
            So Mrs. Davis and I were hurriedly paddled down the bank a way in the felucca, and with
            some of the men went ashore, and down a lane between walls and trees we went and came
            upon the settlement. These wild children of the desert are always most interesting and
            picturesque - the straight delicate features, and strange curling, ringletty hair like a
            Russian poodle’s - Page 41 with the bunchy arrangement of it, and their good carriage
            and beautiful small white teeth. We were too late for the wedding cortège, but were
            shown a low tent, in which the bride was secluded, and to which she had been brought on
            a camel, attended by her friends - and before the tent stood the bridegroom with a drawn
            sword - a handsome fellow - and although he looked quite dramatic, showed a healthy
            interest in the question of baksheesh. The women were making the shrill cry known as the
            zaghareth or joy cry - a shrill, high note, with the mouth rapidly touched with the
            fingers. It sounds exactly like the cry heard also at funerals. We were followed back to
            the boat by a curious crowd of men, women, children and dogs - and I was glad to escape
            from them, not for fear of them, but of the various inhabitants they kept about their
            clothes and persons. Jan. 20. When I got out of bed this morning, I saw the donkeys and
            one very presentable horse, saddled and ready for us, and waiting with donkey boys and
            men to take us to the great Edfou temple - but the wind coming up so fine we decided not
            to stop longer, and Mohammed Salah went on shore to send the animals away and distribute
            proper baksheesh and then we spread our sails for Assouan! It was 7:30 when we got off -
            the wind increased and has lasted all day, so that we have made one of the very best
            runs of our voyage - 49 miles! We passed Silsilis at 2 o’clock and Kom Ombos at 6:30 -
            too late to see it, but as the night was clear and beautiful, it was effective perched
            on its height above Page 42 the river. We were on deck all day with our glasses, looking
            at the rock tombs and façades. The banks in the neighborhood of Silsilis are very
            interesting - the river so narrow, and the great rocks come quite to the water. We are
            now in the granite country - and are lying about 8 miles from Kom Ombos. I took a lot of
            photographs today, principally of the crew. Jan. 21. Assouan. We arrived early this
            afternoon and came almost to the identical spot of our old mooring ground at the island
            of Elephantine. The approach to Assouan is beautiful - the shores are rocky, the yellow
            Egyptian has given place to the dark Nubian. The Busharin give way to the handsome
            Ababdehs - which great tribe of Bedouins control the country in a great measure from the
            east bank of the river to the Red Sea. Theodore and I saw many familiar things as we
            drew along the shore of Elephantine - but the quite imposing new hotel on the Assouan
            bank was not familiar, or the new military store house, with plaza in front and rows of
            guns between the freshly planted lebbek trees. We drew up in front of a little steamer
            which we found occupied by Col. Wodehouse, or Wodehouse Pacha as he is called here, and
            Englishman, and commanding officer of the frontier, who has his headquarters at Wady
            Halfa and was the very person to whom we had to apply for permission to take our boat up
            the Cataract. So instead of telegraphing to Wady Halfa, Theodore went to see him - he
            was very courteous and gave the permission saying that he did not think there was
            danger, Page 43 that they had 3 gunboats cruising up and down the river between Kalabshi
            and Wady Halfa - and that in case of any trouble we would be turned back etc. So
            Theodore decided at once to go, and informed the Captain and crew at once. They are all
            delighted - Salah went over to Assouan this morning to send word to the Sheik of the
            Cataract, with whom a formal bargain must be made. We crossed ourselves, in the felucca,
            went to the P.O. and Telegraph office, and walked through the bazaar. How delightful and
            strangely familiar it all seemed. We had tea on deck after coming home - enjoying the
            view across the river of the town and shipping; the ruins on the hill opposite, and all
            the singular surroundings. I recognized the great sycamore on the island near us - and
            the same old abandoned dahabeah drawn up on the bank under the trees. Jan. 22. 3d Sunday
            after Epiphany. We have been over to the town both this morning and afternoon - walking
            about and buying at the Bazaar. This morning the Sheik of the Cataract arrived, a grave,
            silver haired old man, and the bargain made for taking us up for £20. These Bedouins of
            the Cataract have held the right of conveying boats up the rapids for time immemorial,
            so far as I know. They surround it with great mystery and difficulty - and always
            require 2 days. No doubt it could be done in quicker time and with fewer men. They have
            had little practice of late years since the trouble with the Soudan, as until a year
            ago, no dahabeahs since the war have been allowed up. The only way to reach Wady Halfa
            has been by Postal steamers, controlled by Cook, small and Page 44 wretched, which go up
            and down in one week. We are the first people this year who have asked for permission to
            ascend - and now that the dahabeahs are so large, and made (their hulls) of iron or
            steel, they are not often risked in the Cataract, as a bump on the rocks is much more
            serious for an iron boat, than a wooden one. Jan. 23d. In spite of a high wind we went
            to the Grenfell tombs this morning - I would not have undertaken this expedition again,
            had I not hoped to see something new, as excavations have been going on along that cliff
            for sometime. But we could see nothing of this but clouds of duSt. I hate these climbs
            in the hot sand, with the wind taking your very head off. In the afternoon the rest went
            over to Assouan and took donkeys for a visit to the quarries, and to the barracks, and
            when the afternoon was a little on the wane Theodore and I walked on Elephantine, past
            the Nilometer, climbed to the Roman ruins, and scrambled over the debris of what had
            been human habitations for centuries. It was rough walking but immensely interesting. I
            had to stop once in a while to do a little grubbing - everything looked so promising,
            and I longed to have over some of the sailors with spades and things to dig - I picked
            up two very good nuggets of carnelian. Then we turned into a village which proved to be
            the home of the sailor who was with us, Mehemet Ali - and he stopped to greet his
            friends here and there - until from out of one of the little mud hovels came out a clean
            grave looking woman whom Mehemet Ali greeted as his Page 45 mother - so we stopped to
            speak to her - and Theodore gave her 20 piasters - these people are all Nubians - and
            looked clean and bright - as did their villages - far, far better than those of lower
            Egypt. The women are not veiled, and their mouths have a very peculiar look - I should
            think it must be caused by something they chew - or by an intentional stain - but the
            effect is ghastly - the gums very prominent and a bright purple or slate colour. Then we
            walked by the river bank under the splendid palms, amid the creaking and groaning
            sakkiehs, which are numerous here, as the island is so cultivated, and it was charming
            indeed - for the air was full of pleasant odors from the blossoming crops, and the
            evening fires were beginning to send up their columns of blue smoke - women were filling
            their water jars at the river, and walking off with them strong and stately on their
            heads - flocks were being driven down to the river for water. We came home through
            another village, where we saw several remnants of the past in the way of painted and
            carved temple stones let in to the modern walls - and one great hieroglyphed monster
            stone which must have been an important member of some great temple. For Elephantine has
            had a great and ancient history, dating from the 6th Dynasty, though so little remains
            to tell of it. Our lower deck and the sand bank at which we lie, have been since
            yesterday morning pervaded by a lot of swarthy strangers, with voluminous white turbans
            and black gowns and white shawls squatting about in rows and groups - quiet and watchful
            - and when we ask who they are, we are told they are pilots of the Cataract, or Bedouins
            from Shellal - I think it has been so long since they have had any Page 46 thing to do
            in this line, that they are making the most of it. There are several dahabeahs near us -
            Prof. Sayce has arrived and is just behind us - and Mr. Wilbur with his American flag
            just in front of us. We are all very busy writing letters this evening, laughingly
            declaring that they are our last words to our friends before our probable capture by
            Dervishes. We get off tomorrow. Jan. 25th. The unexpected has happened in the most
            disappointing and exasperating manner. Instead of lying tonight as we had expected to
            do, in the smooth waters under the banks of lovely Philae, we are back again at our
            mooring place at Elephantine, which we left yesterday morning, exalting that we were
            bound for the Cataract. We had hurried through breakfast, and on deck, where
            preparations were being made for our departure - and a large and select audience on the
            sand bank, Bedouins and people from the island who had come to see us off, were watching
            these with great interest. One old gray bearded octogenarian every time we looked his
            way, waving his hands about and shouting blessings, and a safe passage to us, and then
            demanding baksheesh for his good wishes. The Sheik of the Shellal with his special
            assistants of a half dozen Captains, and the same number of helmsmen, and two pilots
            were already on deck - with parcels and rugs and a coffee mill and coils of huge rope -
            for they always take 2 days for this business. Then arrived one of the big Cataract
            boats with about 50 men, who with their big white turbans made a picturesque load - all
            coming on board. Our Page 47 own Rais Mahommed and his crew, had yielded their places
            and authority for the time. The decks were cleared and everything made fast. We made
            ourselves as small as possible, and refrained from parasols. Back in the stern, near the
            helm, were a dozen or more brown fellows with flashing eyes, and as our anchor was
            brought in, and the cables slipped, and we glided off, all of them from the head Reis
            began to divest themselves of their shoes, and much of their clothing. There was a good
            wind - we sailed rapidly along through the familiar scenery of the islands and wonderful
            rocks, and we began to feel much excited as we met with the stronger currents, and
            pulled finely around dangerous corners, and I felt a great elation that I was at last
            doing the thing I had for so many years wanted to do. We were soon near the first big
            rapid, and touched upon a low sand bank to land the men and their ropes - and we could
            see from all over the rocks and islands other men coming with ropes - wading, swimming
            and with almost no clothing. They fastened the ropes to various rocks and began to pull
            us ahead. There had been a tremendous hubbub from the first - so much so that the wonder
            was that any order could be heard and understood - but now, the turmoil increased - all
            the captains shouted to each other, and to all the men - and all the men yelled to the
            Captains and to each other - they bellowed, they gesticulated, they roared - there was a
            difference of opinion between one of the helmsmen and the Sheik - the latter ran from
            his place at the top of one of the companionways back to the helm, and snatched it from
            the steersman - in the meantime we saw that our bow was rapidly approaching a jagged
            point of rock, and Theodore sprang up with a warn Page 48 ing shout, saying “swing her
            bow out, swing her bow out,” and our own Rais and sailors then added their warning
            shouts and rushed to the rescue with bumpers, and their own bodies, but too late - she
            struck and knocked a hole in her bow about 3 inches below the water line. Then there was
            dire confusion for a few seconds - I saw our sailors jumping into the hold, and pulling
            out the stores and things, and begin bailing the water - and Jones went in, and showed
            the men how to stop the leak - he brought out the piece of iron that had been stove in,
            and making a rapid sketch of the hole on the leaf of his pocket book, showed Theodore a
            plan for mending it, which I declared perfectly feasible. All the while the Bedouins
            were shouting and prancing about in the water, until they understood what the damage
            was, when utter consternation fell upon them and Sheik, Captains and all stood
            helplessly staring at Theodore and Jones - it was such an illustration of the
            civilization of the East, versus that of the West - Theodore said to M.S. what is the
            Captain going to do? He is waiting for your order sir, replied M.S. So Theodore ordered
            the boat eased back to the sand bank, and strongly anchored with both anchors, and her
            bow up, bringing the hole above water. Then he decided to send Jones and M.S. into
            Assouan for help, and hailing one of the small Cataract boats that was passing, they
            went off, and in 3 hours were back having seen Wodehouse Pacha, who gave them an order
            for the Engineer of the Government works, who soon arrived and began patching us up for
            getting back to Assouan. We had reluctantly abandoned the idea of getting up to Philae
            in the Herodotus, for even if this engineer could mend us securely, we felt that these
            Bedouins Page 49 might take us from bad to worse and Jones, following Theodore’s
            instructions, had seen Cooks agent at Assouan, and had telegraphed to Cairo asking for
            one of the small Postal steamers that run from the 1st Cataract to Wady Halfa. In 15
            minutes after we had struck, every one of the dripping bronze savages had got into their
            clothes and picked up their belongings, and melted silently away over the rocks and
            islands, M.S. in his rage having actually flayed some of them off the boat - and we were
            left alone, anchored to the little island of rock and sand in the midst of the swirling
            river, which is here very wide and filled with rocks and islands, among which is rushes
            wildly, or spreads out in quiet stretches. Of course we were in a rage of disappointment
            - at least Theodore, Nettie and I were - I don’t think I ever felt so wicked, and during
            the rest of the day we three moped about hardly speaking. Nettie and I clambered up on
            some rocks, amongst some little acacia bushes, and sat down almost weeping. Mrs. Davis
            and Howard however, had visibly brightened under the whole thing - for they had
            cherished I am sure many secret dreads and fears of danger and dervishes, to say nothing
            of the monotonous life on the dahabeah. But there was certainly a charm in our unusual
            situation in that waste of waters, and as the afternoon waned, and the yellow cliffs
            came out in pink tints, and the shores began to darken into violet and purple, the
            silence was only broken by the rush of the rapids, and all night whenever I wakened
            there was the cold fresh air, and the soothing noise of rushing - and I could hardly
            sleep for enjoyment of it. And so this morning we slipped quietly and ignominously back
            to Elephantine, and when we sat down to Page 50 breakfast, we found ourselves looking
            out on the old familiar objects - even the chicken feathers left from our last slaughter
            of fowls, had not blown away from their place. After we had finished breakfast we went
            over for a shopping in the bazaar. I stayed at home during the afternoon, while Nettie
            and Howard walked on Elephantine to “grub” as they said - and brought home some curious
            little things - inscribed potsherds etc. and reported that they had come across a human
            skeleton in their digging. The rest went out in the felucca for a row. Two or three
            quiet hours on the deck alone, under the awnings in the afternoon light, amongst these
            beautiful surroundings, is something to enjoy. Theodore has made all the preparations
            for going to Wady Halfa in the little steamer Semneh, which leaves Shellal next Monday,
            and makes the trip there and back in a week. It will be alas, a very different thing
            from going leisurely along in our own boat, independent of hours and seasons - but we
            will see Nubia - the great temple of Abu Simbel - and the upper river - Mr. Fielding
            will meet us here on our return, coming up from Cairo. Jan. 26. We have had a lovely day
            at Philae once more - and I never thought to see it again! Our hampers, and camp
            equipage and saddles had been sent across the river before breakfast. Aside from our
            elaborate lunch which we always have on these expeditions M.S. takes a folding table,
            chairs, rugs beside all the dishes. After breakfast we crossed ourselves, and found our
            men and donkeys ready, and crossing Page 51 the railway tracks we started out on that
            well remembered and fascinating desert route - climbing the hill, and through the wide,
            strange burying ground, into that famous road or track, which for centuries has been the
            high road from the South to the North - and whose travellers, kings, priests and
            generals have left their inscriptions on the rocks. Since our last visit these have all
            been numbered in white paint, which gives rather an unpleasant sign boardy, ticketed
            museum like air; but it will soon be of great interest, for they have all been
            translated and will soon be published. The rose coloured granite shows everywhere -
            glistening and rosy in the yellow sand - and the drifts of this golden yellow sand in
            the great rifts and hollows of the hills, are beautiful. Then as we approached Philae we
            came upon those strange, fantastic, mammoth bowlders, rounded and worn and piled up upon
            one another in such wonderful fashion. Strabo described them in his time. On arriving at
            Philae, I soon saw “Yemma” my delightful little dragoman somewhat changed and grown,
            though I knew him at once, and although he seemed to know me, I did not believe he
            really did, until after a while he asked me to take my paper and pencil and write his
            picture, as I did before! Then I remembered that Mary made a sketch of him, and so he
            really knew, and had placed me. He had all his pretty ways - that quaint care-taking
            manner, and sympathetic watchfulness - and he pulled at my heart strings all the time,
            just as he did two years ago. Nettie was in raptures over Philae. We found the Newmans
            as usual in the painted portico, and as usual, very nice - and they made us promise to
            go down to their boat the “Hapi” (Hapi being the God of the Nile) after Page 52
            luncheon. The rest declined to climb down the steep bank and then up again, so Theodore
            and I went - found their boat charming, as well as themselves - and we stayed an
            unconscionable time. I had never seen Mr. Newman’s pictures, and had never felt an
            interest in them - but we were much pleased with them and Theodore bought one, a view
            from the Philae colonnade, for the large sum I thought of £200. Our donkeys had been
            sent round to the village of Mahatta, and we were rowed across, and then home through
            this village and Shellal and both typical Nubian villages, the former one before the
            trade with the Soudan was destroyed by the war, was a picturesque port, the caravans
            from the South lading and unlading there. Miss Edwards even in her day, describes its
            attractions. A fascinating ride that was in the late afternoon, through that strange
            scenery. We have had strong West winds for 2 days. Jan. 27. Home all day - very high
            wind - Theodore and Nettie had a delightful ramble on Elephantine - and in the afternoon
            all except myself rode out to the quarries, and then to the Barracks to see the
            Soudanese dance which goes on all day every Friday - I had another quiet afternoon on
            deck - I am ruining myself buying amber beads at the bazaar - and have been busy washing
            and restringing them. The night being so brilliant, Nettie and Howard, with Jones and
            Mohammed went back to the barracks to see the dance by moonlight. Our little cat
            Mish-mish, can hardly be recognized for the thin, timid, neglected Page 53 cat we took
            on board at Cairo. She is fat and big - and most self-reliant and daring - she goes to
            the top of the companion way, when she finds her saucer of milk on our deck empty, and
            yowls so to the cook below, that every one laughs, and Ali is sent up with a fresh
            supply. She stays below in our quarters, or on our deck with us, and keeps all her
            toilet requisites under one of the divans. Jan. 28. Another day at lovely Philae - rode
            over and found it excessively warm. Yemma was waiting for me; he had told Mrs. Newman
            that his “Sitt” was coming from Assouan today. There was another little fellow I had
            never before seen. The most delicious little savage “Dehdowah”, not much bigger than his
            name, but so solid and square, with such big cheeks, and very big soft eyes - he was too
            delightful. He attached himself to Howard Amory, and reached just about to his knee.
            Like Yemma, he carried a fly whisk, and kept the flies off his chosen patron with great
            solemnity. Such composure and self reliance I have never seen in a small person before.
            There are a few families living over on the small and interesting island of Biggeh
            opposite Philae, and their little mud houses are clustered about what remains of a small
            temple. The Newmans have them under their special protection it would seem - and these
            little people come from there, and pass backwards and forwards between it and Philae,
            quite independent of boats by rolling up their single little cotton garment on their
            heads and swimming across. Mrs. Newman says Yemma’s Page 54 family and kindred are quite
            exceptional savages - and I should think they might be. She teaches them, sews for them,
            nurses them if they are ill, lectures them and is generally guardian saint to them - and
            as this is the fourth winter the Newmans have lain at Philae in their boat, she knows
            them well. Yemma has acquired some new English words, I heard him say distinctly several
            times today to some of the other children, “shut up”. We did not ride all the way home,
            but after another long visit to the Newmans, we took one of the Cataract boats, which
            are large rowboats with comfortable cushioned seats, and a sail, and some dozen men to
            row, and went back as far as the big cataract, which some of the Bedouins swim down for
            the pleasure of the tourists, and a small baksheesh. I had seen the thing before, and
            did not enjoy the sight of the shivering, dripping men as they came out of the water
            well enough to wish to see it again. So the rest went off leaving me with one boatman.
            It was a delicious half hour - the waning light of the afternoon - the quiet, broken
            only by the rushing water, that strange scenery and wide desolation. As soon as the
            others got out of sight, my boatman got out, washed himself - spread his outer cotton
            dress on the sand, and began his devotions. It was a sight much better worth the seeing
            than the one the others had gone to see. One can never say too much or think, or see too
            much of this wonderful rock scenery of the Cataract, such strange polished and rounded
            rocks, worn by the action of water into such fantastic shapes, the water having left a
            black deposit of iron on them, so that they look like mammoth castings - and then these
            ancient hieroglyphs on the still more ancient Page 55 rocks! Home by Mahatta as before.
            Jan. 29. Septuagesima Sunday. A very quiet day. I have done a little reading and getting
            ready for leaving tomorrow morning - sailed across the river in the afternoon, and
            walked through the bazaar quite to the end of the town - the hills and palms a pretty
            sight. I am immensely sorry we do not take Jones or Mohammed with us tomorrow. Cook has
            been so very unaccommodating, and declares that, as there is a dragoman on the steamer,
            he will charge £10 extra for Mohammed, and the same for Jones - Theodore pays the
            enormous sum of £180 for the boat, not including baksheesh and it seems most
            unreasonable, there being only 5 of us, we cannot take the two men, without this extra
            charge. Jan. 30th. We left Assouan at 9 o’clock this morning in the train for Shellal.
            Most of our crew went across the river with us, and waited until the little train
            started - giving us dozens of farewells - Jones, Mohammed and Abbocatto and Hanna Ibram
            our cook, went to Shellal with us, and spent the day at Philae. There were many of Cooks
            tourists in the train, for 2 steamers beside our own were going - and after that short
            brotherhood were very glad we were to be by ourselves. We lay at the bank sometime
            getting in our stores, and had time to examine our quarters and settle ourselves. It was
            not very encouraging though everything was clean. Our staterooms open on the outside
            deck, Page 56 and are fairly comfortable with one person in each - but I dread to think
            what they would be crowded with miscellaneous people - for all the 8 rooms hold 2, 3, or
            4 people. There is no sitting room. The little dining room just over the wheel at the
            stern is a comfortless appartment, and so very joggly with the motion of the wheel, that
            we are obliged to have the engine slowed when we are eating. The sailing out from Philae
            was beautiful - we got off at 11 o’clock. Soon the river broadened, the scenery became
            less wild, the cliffs fell away on either hand - on the West, the yellow Libyan desert
            quite to the water, and but a bit of a strip of verdure on the EaSt. At Kertassi we see
            the ruins of a small temple, with a few columns and one architrave remaining in place -
            then Tafeh, and some more ruins. Then we passed through Bab-el-Kalabshi, a solemn gloomy
            gorge of the river, with black rocks and islets, and bends and shallows, on one of the
            islands, large brick ruins - then Kalabshi and its temple, which with the smaller one of
            Bet el-Walli we intend seeing on our way down. All the afternoon I was on the little
            deck outside my room, with my opera glass and book - enjoying the beautiful stretches of
            the river, so unlike the lower Nile - the villages not so frequent, but of better type -
            many of the houses with arched roofs, and some of them looking almost like forts, with
            large enclosing outside walls for protection ; passed some splendid sycamores - the true
            Plantamus Occidentalis, being a native of Egypt. Stopped at 7 o’clock P.M. at Dendûr,
            having made 50 miles. A Mr. Fowler came on board from the other steamer “Oonas” lying
            close by, and spent the evening - an Englishman, to whom Theodore Page 57 had been
            introduced this morning - very agreeable - and had wide political knowledge, and we
            discussed Egyptian affairs - of which he knew a great deal. Every one is reading Milner,
            which we have brought along, I not having finished it - Theodore has read it. The night
            is superb - we have passed the Tropic of Cancer. A cold wind all day. Jan. 31. I was
            awakened by the start this morning at 4 o’clock - slept again, and wakened at 7. This
            little boat rackets about so, under the working of her engine, that I was almost rattled
            out of bed. I found we were stopping at Dakkeh - where is a ruined Ptolemaic temple
            built on the site of an ancient one of the Middle period. It was opposite here that an
            important stele was found describing the route to the gold mines of Wadi Kaki, of the 3d
            year of Ramses II. Passengers of the Oonas stopped here to visit the temple, but having
            stopped ourselves to take on the manager, we kept on, preferring to give our time more
            leisurely to the best things. It seems these 3 boats are run with but one dragoman, and
            a person they call the Manager, whose head quarters are on our boat. Yesterday, we had
            no one on board speaking English but the Engineer, who is English - and the 3 young Arab
            servants are particularly helpless and ineffective; so we were very glad to have this
            manager, who speaks English almost perfectly. He is a Syrian by birth, with an English
            mother - and is most attentive to us. The desert now comes down almost to the river on
            both sides - and we wonder what the poor people live on in this part of Nubia. The
            occasional strip of Page 58 arable land, has splendid palms - and they are treated with
            the greatest care - most of them in little encircling mud walls of their own and the
            sakkiehs are very close together and worked constantly. The villages look indescribably
            dreary, perched on the desert slopes of the hills, for arable land is too precious here
            for human habitations, and we could scarcely descry them at times without the glass, so
            entirely were they the colour of the mountains and desert. How hot and dreary they did
            look in the merciless glare of the sun - not a green thing about them, and the few
            people sitting under the shadow of the walls, or moving about looking like large black
            flies. The river is lonely - no boats - no life on it - deep, with no sand banks. We
            pass Sabûrah at lunch time, and rush out to see it, lying shrowded in a golden sand
            drift - with only the pylons to be seen, two sphynxes, and two statues of Rameses II
            standing before them; who built this temple and dedicated it to Ammon and Ptah. It is on
            the walls of the court of this temple, that a procession of the children of Rameses II
            appear - each with his name. If this list is correct, this great Rameses must have been
            quite the father of a family, for it accords him 111 sons and 67 daughters! This temple
            is worth seeing, but we are going to stop to do that when we come down. The afternoon
            was very warm and still - and we sat on the little upper deck, delighted with the
            beautiful scenery. Occasionally great rocky detached peaks rising from the desert, and
            desert desolation everywhere. We reached Korosko about 5 o’clock. Korosko has always
            seemed to me for some reason very interesting and African, and at the very verge of
            civilization. I suppose because I have read of Page 59 travellers to the interior
            starting from Korosko for the long ride to Abu Hamad across the desert, avoiding in this
            way the three upper cataracts. It has lost almost entirely its former importance in this
            way - for no caravans arrive and depart now. There is a large garrison here, and we
            walked about it, finding it most interesting - the soldiers’ quarters especially built
            in the midst of a palm forest - the officers’ quarters very attractive - and I was quite
            touched by a little carefully tended flower garden, with familiar European and English
            flowers in it, looking very dejected and homesick I must say. There was the most
            wonderful effect of sunset flush and moonlight as we walked back to the boat. Started
            again, and made Amada by 8 o’clock. Theodore, Nettie and Howard with the Manager went up
            to see the temple by moonlight. It is well worth seeing, being an excellent example of
            the architecture of the 18th dynasty. Feb. 1st. We started at 4 A.M. and made Abu Simbel
            by one o’clock, - 51 miles. We passed Derr before I was dressed and Ibrim, and further
            on Kasr-Ibrim, where there is a large ruined Roman fortress - then Toski, near which
            place on Aug. 3, 1889 the British army under Gen. Grenfell and Col. Wodehouse, defeated
            a large force of Dervishes, led by Wad el-Nejumi, one of the Mahdi’s most valiant
            chieftains. It was he who conquered Hicks, and let the final attack on Khartoum, and
            might have proved a dangerous enemy to Egypt. Near Ibrim the land near the river was
            green with palms - and the sakkiehs were busy - but elsewhere Page 60 and expecially as
            we approached Abu Simbel the country seemed utterly desert and uninhabited, and the
            houses in the occasional villages looked like rude fortresses with pylon like
            structures. We sat on the deck, watching with our glasses for the first glimpse of the
            Abu Simbel figures - at last I began to make them out, but they had a most unexpected
            look to me, familiar as I was with them through photographs. We drew near rapidly,
            slowing up as we passed the beautiful façade of the other rock temple of Queen Nefertari
            - and were then almost under the Colossi of the great temple. It was one o’clock when we
            stopped, and we had made a run of 51-1/2 miles. We had lunch with the doors of the
            little cabin open and the natives were beginning to collect on the bank much interested
            in our doings. We were congratulating ourselves as we got off, that we were so much in
            advance of the other boats. There is only a narrow path in the sand, at the foot of the
            cliffs - and as we stood on deck we seemed almost able to touch the rocks. We climbed
            around the steep bank, and across the foot of the great drift of golden sand, which has
            blown across the desert behind the mountain, and overflowed in one enormous sheer
            unbroken line almost to the waters edge - quite cutting off one corner of the façade.
            They are truly stupendous things these Colossi, and the longer I sat and looked at them,
            the more fascinating they grew. We stayed a long time staring up at them from every
            angle, and a still longer time inside - only coming out when the people from the other
            boats began climbing up. I sat a long time on the tomb of the English officer buried
            there - and tried to forget the wretched fellaheen who Page 61 were crowding about with
            their wretched beads etc. for sale - and I was amused to see in the crowd of tourists
            who came up from the other boats, a large proportion of them more interested in these
            things than in the temple, and spending large part of their short allotted time with
            them. But what a place in which to be buried! such views up and down the great stretches
            of the river - the vast desolation and silence of the desert everywhere, and the four
            seated Colossi smiling in eternal watchfulness, over all! Then we climbed down, and went
            along the little rocky path to the smaller temple, which we found delightfully
            interesting. I think the faces and forms of the Queen and of Isis on several parts of
            the temple walls, the most beautiful things I have ever seen in Egyptian art. After a
            most lovely sunset and dinner we went up in the moonlight to the great temple again -
            the clamoring natives had all gone home, the other boats had gone, and the silence, and
            the moonlight on those great stony countenances, was splendidly solemn. The night is
            cold - and the wind strong, and we are to be called tomorrow at 3 o’clock to see the
            Southern Cross - all but Theodore, who declines to be awakened. Feb. 2d. It seemed to me
            this morning when one of the men knocked at my door to tell me it was half past 3
            o’clock, that I had not been asleep more than half an hour. I climbed down from my bed
            very quietly and pushed open my window which fortunately opened to the east, and looked
            out for the Great Cross - Nettie and Howard and the Manager Page 62 were just outside,
            and were talking to Theodore who had his head out of his window. They pointed out the
            Cross, which is seen here much foreshortened and as it were in perspective, and is
            somewhat disappointing. Then I closed my window for the morning was very cold, and
            climbed again into my high, narrow little bed, intending to get up at dawn, and see the
            Colossi emerge from the gloom of the night. It was hardly more than 5 o’clock when I
            again got up and opened my window and looked out upon one of the most beautiful
            spectacles I ever saw. It was quite dark except in the East, where a soft crimson color
            was beginning to stir, and just above which a splendid planet shone and shot its silvery
            light across the placid water, quite to the boat. I hope I never may forget that lovely
            sight! We were soon all but Theodore, on the upper deck shivering in the chill morning
            air, and just as the light began to break across those four great faces, we saw our
            steersman climb into his wheel house, the engine began to work, and we were off for Wady
            Halfa, which we reached at 12:30 making 40 miles. The country from Abu Simbel to Wady
            Halfa is undescribably desert, and very grand in its desolation - great detached
            mountain slopes, evidently the remains of former ranges, but worn and separated by water
            action, their tops, snowed over as it were, with a blackish deposit, some specimens of
            which I got - looking like klinkers from a furnace - or small black stalactites -
            everywhere were the splendid rifts of orange golden sand - to me one of the most
            beautiful features of the Upper Nile. We passed the ruins of a Saracen fortress, then
            the strange tumuli that Miss Edwards describes, one of which they opened, as far as
            their im Page 63 plements would allow. Wady Halfa looked very pretty as we passed near
            the fort. Mohammed had given me some presents for his people - one of the long thick
            woolen wraps that the better class wear, black, with a little embroidery at the edges,
            and one of the wide, long black scarfs for his uncle - also £1 for him. For his wife 2
            pairs of really handsome silver bracelets, and £2, and another black shawl for his
            cousin Suleyman Ali Kara. The Salah family are quite people of importance in that part
            of Nubia. Mohammed had telegraphed his uncle to meet us on the arrival of the steamer,
            and arrange for taking us out to his place. He proved a most venerable looking old man,
            with brown face and white beard, surmounted by a voluminous white turban, and with
            flowing garments of soft white wool - and an excellent manner - he had with him Suleyman
            Ali Kara a handsome fellow with his black curling moustache under his white turban. They
            came back in the afternoon with donkeys for us. We had asked through an interpretation
            of the manager, in the morning how far the Salah place might be - if it was in walking
            distance, and the answer was about half an hour - so knowing the uncertainty of their
            time limits, we had gratefully accepted their offers of donkeys - and very glad we were,
            for after passing the fort, we rode 2 miles into the desert, coming at last to a large
            fort like enclosure, a high wall surrounding a large enclosure - with only one opening -
            a large entrance door, with seats on either side of it against the wall, where a lot of
            men were waiting to receive us - a forest of palms lying between it and the river. We
            went into a court from which opened the houses of various members of the family - and
            were conducted to the Page 64 state appartments or habitation - where, in one corner of
            the court, entirely open on one side we were asked to sit down. There was a raised dais
            like place across one end of the room - and above this were hanging some embroidered
            saddle cloths and things. The rest of the appartment was covered with nice rugs, and
            cushioned divans and chairs, and a low table set out with very pretty china - and we
            were immediately served with coffee, and large soup plates full of popped corn, with
            piles of dates in the middle. Then we asked to see Mohammed’s Mother, and his new wife,
            to whom he had been married since we were here last, his first wife and child being dead
            - and they came in to see us. So long as Theodore and Howard stayed, they would not
            uncover their faces, but when they went away to see something else, we persuaded them to
            take off their veils. The mother was a clean looking old woman - but the wife was lovely
            - tall and slim with brown oval face - the softest eyes - the whitest teeth - and very
            engaging gentle ways. I was a little shocked to see her hair in the tiny Nubian braids
            which are so ugly. She is the cousin of Mohammed - being the daughter of the old stately
            white haired man - who was formerly a person of wealth and slaves and possessions -
            owning a large fertile island in the river some miles south of Wady Halfa - but the
            Dervishes descended upon that part of the country a few years ago, and destroyed
            everything. Many members of his family were killed - all his brothers - and he and his
            daughter are now dependent on Mohammedan’s generosity. I gave the mother and wife the
            gifts Mohammed had sent, which I had wrapped in colored papers and tied with ribbons -
            and then we five women talked Page 65 as well as we could - we being totally ignorant of
            their language as they of ours, - we laughed a great deal - and showed them our rings
            and watches. I think they were more amused with my lorgnette than anything else. Then we
            told each others names - the tall, pretty young wife is named Iamai. Then we went into
            the other part of the court to see some of the other women - fine, clean looking women
            they all were - and from every door emerged heads of children and women, who no doubt
            were as curious about us, as we were about them. Then we said an elaborate goodbye - and
            the old man and Suleyman brought us home - and the ride across the desert in the evening
            light was very pleasant with the remembrance of that patriarchal family scene behind us.
            Having said goodbye to our kind hosts, and presented the gifts of Mohammed and declined
            a sheep in return, we took a walk about the garrison, looking so pretty under its palm
            trees - it is of very large extent - covering more than a mile, I should think - in
            admirable order - and the quarters of the officers, especially of the Commanding
            officer, Wodehouse Pacha, looked delightfully pleasant on the bank of the river,
            embowered in vines and shrubberies - the bougainvillia in full magenta bloom. Theodore
            was invited to spend the evening with Wodehouse Pacha, and is now up there. I brought
            along Milners book on England and Egypt to read - which I find doubly interesting in
            these scenes. We have been having a great many little jokes on our way up about falling
            into the hands of dervishes. Our nice looking black Reis, has been under fire more than
            once on the river and our jolly looking English engineer has also seen service on the
            river during the war - and is quite interesting. I must Page 66 say that I have felt it
            reassuring when we have been tied up to these desolate shores at night, to reflect that
            an English gun boat was near. It is very cold tonight with a strong north wind - and it
            has been cold for 2 days - and we have been eating our meals in our comfortless little
            stern dining room with our hats and coats on - and sit about in the evening done up in
            all our rugs and wraps. It is certainly what I had not expected of the Tropic of Cancer,
            on so near an acquaintance. Feb. 3d. This morning we took a long walk through the
            garrison and home by the river bank - everything was in perfect order and beautifully
            clean - the black, black Soudanese soldiers - as well as the yellow Egyptian soldiers
            had such a good air of training and discipline - the Egyptian officers were very smart.
            The low, whitewashed buildings, with the yellow desert on one side, and palm groves and
            the river on the other - the sun intensely bright and hot, and the wind strong and cold
            - I am always reminded of the man in the fable, in the race between the wind and the
            sun, in this country. Last night the thermometer went down to 44°. Since the last
            dervish raids, tourists are not allowed as formerly to go out several miles beyond the
            fort, to see the 2d cataract from the top of Abousir. I should like to have seen it, and
            especially looked down the road, along which poor, brave, deluded Gordon started on his
            way to Khartoum. We spent the rest of the morning until 11 o’clock wandering about and
            looking over Wodehouse Pacha’s queer boat - then started at 11 o’clock - and reached Abu
            Sim Page 67 bel at 2 o’clock. We found the same group of hopeless natives assembled on
            shore - the deaf and dumb man, with his prolific smiles, and gestures, making the same
            hideous noises, to show that he was a worthy recipient of charity and baksheesh, the
            same woman with the silver bracelets and earrings for sale, and all the rest of the
            clamouring crowding people with their beads and “antikas”. We had a delightful hour or
            more at the big temple before the Oonah and Ankeh arrived, and their people came
            climbing up through the sand. Our little Hassan the kindest and nicest of attendants had
            brought out 2 soda bottles, and filled them for me, and filled them with the lovely,
            tawny sand near the door of the temple - and just here, peeping out from its yellow sand
            shrowd is the top of a beautiful portal - we could not resist trying to dig it out a
            little - but the drift is so steep in incline, and so enormous in weight, that it poured
            down again like a pink golden rain. If I were very, very rich, I would bring a great
            army of work people, and under the best engineering skill that could be had, I would
            have that mountain of sand dug away, and the never failing supply from above diverted
            and this splendid rock temple laid entirely bare. We got away at 5:30, straining our
            eyes to the last moment to see those great smiling faces - we are now 9:30 at Ibrim,
            having made 80 miles today. The wind has been so cold and strong, that we could not half
            enjoy the beautiful colour effects on the mountains. We have stayed in our little cabins
            wrapped in our rugs and cloaks. I have finished Milner - a timely and immensely
            interesting book - and one that must have great political effect. Page 68 Feb. 4th. Got
            away from Ibrim at 7:30 A.M, the day has been cold and cloudy - and I was in my room
            most of the time reading - I wanted to land and visit the temple of Amade, but no one
            else seemed inclined to do it, and so we passed on. Reached Korosko at 11 o’clock and
            left at 1:30. The rest went on shore, and again visited the garrison - as did also the
            French people from the dahabeah Teheran, which we found lying here - and they were all
            asked into the Colonel’s quarters and given coffee - and shown about - and a special
            camel drill improvised for them - and they brought back to the steamer, a very smart
            Egyptian Captain who spoke English very well, though some of his expressions were
            unusual and amusing. For instance, speaking of the wild fighting and excitement of the
            black soldiers under fire, and the difficulty of restraining them, he said, touching his
            head significantly “a man wants to have all his wise, when he goes into battle”. We
            passed Suburah late in the afternoon, and as the river on that side was very shallow
            requiring a small boat, and the Semneh carried none, we very reluctantly passed that by.
            Tonight we are lying at Dakkeh, very glad indeed that it is our last night on this
            wretched little boat. How different Nubia, and the Upper Nile, and everything would have
            been, if we had been loitering along in the Herodotus, coming in for a thousand
            impressions and experiences that we could never get on a steamer, I can faintly imagine.
            But now that the first disappointment has worn off, I feel that we could ill have spent
            the time, for it would have taken a month or more, and the river is falling rapidly, and
            there is always Page 69 the chance of there not being sufficient water to get a boat
            down the Cataract. All the same, Nubia would have been a very different thing. Feb. 5th.
            Sexagisima Sunday. We left Dakkeh at 4:30, and when I came out of my room before
            breakfast, we were lying just under the temple of Kalabahi, with a row of natives on the
            bank, dangling strings of beads, and brushes of feathers, and barbaric arms, and
            chickens and pigeons - and patiently waiting until we should become their prey - and
            when after breakfast we did climb the bank, we came in for a fine clamour. I never saw
            so many beads - all of them barbaric. The temple is Ptolemaic - greatly in ruins, and
            hardly worth a visit - and we were back in the boat and off for Shellal as soon as we
            could, which we reached at 1 o’clock P.M. - having made 63 miles. As soon as we drew up,
            we discerned across at Philae, Mohammed and then Jones and Mr. Fielding, who had arrived
            at Assouan the night before - and they were soon with us. Mr. Fielding under a large
            white Chinese hat, quite like a huge extinguisher he having after his voyage with Lord
            Braye, around the world, left him at Cairo, and come up the river to join us. Mr. Newman
            had also sent his felucca with his men, and the picture Theodore had bought - and that
            with all our traps was piled on a camel, and sent across to Assouan then there was a
            great settling of backsheeshs, and saying goodbye - and we got into one of the Cataract
            boats and went across to see the Newmans, who were just starting for an afternoon on
            Biggeh, and begged us as we had never been there, to join them, so leaving Nettie and
            Field Page 70 ing at Philae, we went, and in spite of the heat, were repaid; for the
            little island is extraordinary - its shores piled high with the strange rounded black
            rocks, leaving a little desert in the center where a few palm trees grow - under which
            stood 2 or 3 columns of a ruined temple, around which are the little huts of Yemma’s
            family - I saw the little fellow for the last time and said goodbye, and we all set off
            in our Cataract boat to make the descent of the Cataract, which is very exciting - such
            a wild swirl of waters, through which the crew labor with their oars - we were soon
            approaching the Herodotus, where our Rais and all the smiling brown faces of our crew,
            were waiting to receive us - and how charming and luxurious and even vast the interior
            seemed! A huge mail of letters and papers we found and our little Mish-mish went into a
            whirl of delighted play with me. Feb. 6th. Jones tells us that a caravan of 40 camels
            laden with gum came into Assouan one day last week from Berber, having come that
            distance in 60 days. He said Mohammed went out beyond the barracks, where they were
            encamped on the edge of the desert, to see them. We saw some of the men when we went
            into the bazaar this morning - a row of great, swarthy men squatting outside one of the
            native cafés - how their eyes did flash and how they showed their white teeth, and how
            they looked exactly as if they had come out of the “Arabian Nights”. Home all the
            afternoon. Page 71 Feb. 7th. We went over to Assouan this morning - and as Mr. Fielding
            had never seen the schools here, we went first to the Government School and then to the
            American Mission School - I had been telling him that these Mission schools were too
            narrow in their teachings and of too distinctly a religious type - and although their
            influence has been great, it has been confined entirely to the Copts and the children of
            foreigners - we found the Gov. school in quite a large building with an inside court for
            recreation, and with the school rooms arranged about it, all very clean and in perfect
            order. Milner, in his “England in Egypt” says that the advance in education reform has
            been very great in the last 3 years. The old teaching of the Koran, and the exclusion of
            every thing in the way of science and literature that was not of Arabic origin
            necessarily limited educational results, until the deficiency was keenly realized by the
            public. Under the general progress in all things which has taken place under the
            fostering English influence, this matter of education has made such steady strides, that
            now there are 42 government schools - 6 primary ones of lower grade - 34 of higher
            grade, and 2 Secondary schools which are at Cairo. These schools as to management and
            method are under the best modern influences, and either French or English as is wished
            by the pupils, is taught. The old teaching of the Ulamas, who are really the priests and
            prophets of the great El Azhar at Cairo, is now a thing of the past. All of this seems
            to me one of the greatest of revolutions, and must bring the evident results in progress
            and modern civilization Page 72 one of which must be that Moslemism must undergo a
            reformation, as being distinctly alien to modern thought and progress - or else take its
            place amongst the dead faiths of the world. Well -- on this occasion we went into the
            English class room of the lowest grade, where were some 40 boys of from 10 - 14 years of
            age I should think. The room was bright, with fine maps, drawings for object lessons,
            blackboards etc. on the walls - the boys seated on the usual school forms, with desks
            before them - making the greatest possible contrast to the ordinary native schools I had
            seen, where the children had been seated on the ground swaying their bodies about in a
            senseless repetition of the Koran. All of these boys were clean in person and dress -
            some of them were put through recitations and readings, and their copy books were shown,
            with really beautiful and legible writing, and I thought they contrasted more than
            favorably with the books of a like American class of boys - and the wonder was that
            these Mohammedan boys had been studying English not quite 4 months! Their recitations
            were very amusing - two of them, one after another, repeated the little child’s poem so
            well known to American children, “Little sheep, pray tell me why, in the pleasant fields
            you lie” - the h taking the sound of z in most cases. It seemed to me one of the most
            promising school rooms I had ever seen, and when we walked a few minutes after into the
            single large, dirty, and disorderly school room of the American Mission, where some of
            the ill assorted scholars of the 1st class, the brightest being a Copt boy of 12, and
            the dullest a big, shuffling jet black negro of 20 or more years, read in their turn
            verse by verse, a part of one of Page 73 the most uninstructive chapters of the new
            Testament, the contrast was very great. The American Mission School has undoubtedly done
            its best work in this country - when before the reformation in the Gov. schools they
            educated to a certain degree, a restricted class. Though their wish and aim from the
            first has been a missionary one to prosylites, they confessed to us at the American
            College in Assiout when we were here before, that they were never successful, as a
            Moslem changed into a Christian is almost unknown. We afterwards went to the bazaar,
            where we spent the rest of the morning. In the afternoon Mrs. Davis and Fielding went
            over to Philae, and back by a cataract boat. The rest of us took our felucca with sail,
            about 4 o’clock, and sailed up towards the Cataract - the wind quite failed - but the
            evening was very lovely - with strange cloud effects - and a few rain drops fell - the
            day has been very warm - we are waiting for a good south wind to start down the river.
            Mr. Peto came up in his little dahabeah, the Camile yesterday, and is just behind us.
            Feb. 8th. A strong north wind blowing this morning we thought it not worthwhile
            attempting to move. It was cold, and Nettie and I went out to walk up and down the sand
            bank in the sun. Mr. Peto came to meet us and ask us to go and have a look at his little
            boat, and see his monkey - Jocko proved quite delightful, the prettiest monkey I ever
            saw - quite small, with a great deal of soft brown hair, and very gentle ways. The
            Camile was a most artistic little boat - outside and in - Page 74 Mr. Peto is entirely
            alone, and has things all his own way - he is an architect, very well known I believe in
            London - very artistic and aesthetic. The cabin was all in white paint with dark blue
            and pale green furnishings - Cairo pottery - blue bead mummy decorations etc. etc. Then
            he brought Jocko over to our boat to introduce him to the cat, Jocko making not the
            slightest show of attention, but poor Mish-mish going into shivers of rage of the sight
            of him. Then we all crossed the river, walking through the bazaar to the end of the
            town, and blinded by the clouds of dust blown into our faces from every quarter - it is
            quite cool. We hope to get off tomorrow - I saw a black tall straight Soudanese woman
            walking along the edge of the town, black as night, with her silver ornaments - and
            white robes, with red stripes at the edges - how capable, and strong and quiet she
            looked. Feb. 9th. The north wind was again wildly disporting itself as we looked out on
            the river this morning, which was a ghastly brown color, and we moped about until just
            after luncheon, when there came as we thought a final lull, and we began our
            preparations for sailing - and had pulled out into the middle of the river, when it
            burst out again with redoubled fury, and it was with some difficulty that avoiding the
            rocks, we could bring up to the shore at Assouan just under the hotel. The clouds grew
            blacker and the rain began and lasted until 5 o’clock, when having let up a little
            Theodore proposed going up into the bazaar and buying some thin curtains for the cabin
            windows - which we have Page 75 been intending to do all the way up. So we set off in a
            hurry, and found most of the shops closed - however we succeeded in getting some of the
            very cheap and pretty manchester cotton which is made for the Soudanese women - a kind
            of soft cheese cloth, with thick borders of red and green. Then we took a last long walk
            beyond the bazaar towards the barracks, and home by the river path - past the
            Dispensary, and the clean attractive looking grain markets, and so back to our boat. Mr.
            Wilbur came over and made us a long visit this evening - and the talk was all of Egypt
            and Egyptian things. The thermometer has been 54° all day. Feb. 10th. It rained softly,
            but steadily most of the night, and I laid in bed this morning after the shutters had
            been opened, looking up to the dripping bank, and the hotel above, and the few miserable
            figures in their thin cotton clothes, coming and going along the path in front of the
            hotel. Rain seems so incongruous in this country - all its attributes in the way of
            umbrellas and overshoes etc. being entirely unknown here - and the flowing cotton gowns
            looking so inadequate and inappropriate. It is cold - 58° - and it has rained hard at
            intervals all day. We have been sitting about writing and making our curtains. Feb. 11.
            It cleared last night a little - but the morning was cold and threatening - almost a
            snow sky - our wet and bedraggled decks with the Page 76 furniture heaped about and
            covered with rugs and canvas, was dismal enough as we stood about watching the getting
            off, a crowd of natives on the bank watching us - among them our friend of the India
            shop, who looked quite sad. We moved off slowly - slipping by one after another well
            known landmark - how sad it is to let these things go for what is probably the last
            time. We get off about 10 o’clock, and floating and rowing we made until we pulled up
            for the night, about 15 miles. I devoted the day to writing letters. Feb. 12.
            Quinquagesima Sunday. A clear fine day at last - started about 7 and made Kom Ombo at 2
            o’clock. Crowds of workmen were busy at excavating, and the dust of their labours
            ascended to heaven. We landed a little distance below the temple, and started to walk -
            but the cold wind was blowing hard, and Theodore suffering from a bad cold, I persuaded
            him to turn back with me. We were very glad, as the others stayed but a short time not
            being allowed to enter the temple, and being choked to death by the duSt. At 5 o’clock
            we left and went on until after 6 o’clock, when we stopped for the night having made in
            spite of the strong north wind 15 miles. Feb.13. We have been virtually laid up today -
            making 3 miles by 10 o’clock when we laid up before a strong gale from the north. I had
            a little walk on the shore in the afternoon. Theodore who has a cold, had been Page 77
            playing chess with Mr. Fielding most of the day - with a lamp lighted to bring up the
            temperature in his room. We have been reading a horribly fascinating book - Major
            Wingate’s narrative of the story told him by the Missionary German priest, Father
            Obewalder, of his imprisonment 10 years ago with 7 men by the Malidi - and his escape
            with the two men remaining alive, some months ago. It is the most awful tale of wild
            cruelty and bloodshed and adventure ever read - and must precipitate public feeling
            toward English occupation of Egypt - I am sure if we had read these blood curdling tales
            of Dervish cruelty before we went to Wady Halfa, our courage would have failed us. Feb.
            14th. We started early this morning reaching Begel Silsileh soon after breakfast, in
            spite of the strong head wind. There the Nile is immensely interesting - the mountain
            chains on either side coming close together - and the special worship of the river at
            this point is supposed to date from a time when the gorge of the river was narrower than
            it now is, and the passage difficult. The rock chapels and inscribed tablets lie on the
            western bank, where we landed - and climbed about over the rocky paths and waded through
            the sand, and visited them all. The rock chapel of Horus, and speos of Rameses II and
            Merenptah 1st. Lovely things they must have been with their bright colors and beautiful
            papyrus bud columns at the facades. The Horus speos looked even more ruinous than it did
            when we were here 2 years ago. The beautiful Isis with the infant Horus, and all the
            triumphal scene of King Horus returning from the miserable land of Kush, are delightful
            - and I re Page 78 cognized again with pleasure the gentleman with the coachman’s capes!
            A Hymn to the Nile, lofty and inspired in style is given in the inscriptions on this
            west bank - the translation of which is worth reading in the different books. How
            strange the river must have looked in those days, with the rich colours and carvings on
            the rocks - and the strange little recesses, with their sitting figures always reminding
            me of what Miss Edwards said of them, that they looked like owners in their opera boxes.
            The wind having fallen very much, and Theodore in a hurry to get on, we did not cross to
            the east side to see the important and impressive quarries which we visited before - and
            the lesser ones on the west side give an inadequate idea of what they are - immense
            avenues cut through the sandstone rock, as clean and straight as possible for 50 and 60
            feet - with the wedge openings plainly visible. Miss Edwards description of these is
            wonderful. We got away at lunch time, and are now half way to Edfou, having made 22
            miles. Feb. 15. Started at 7 this morning, reached Edfou at 9 o’clock, and went off
            immediately after breakfast to the temple. How perfect and interesting it is - one can
            in imagination see the strange and solemn services that once filled this great temple
            with their splendor and ceremony. Nettie and I with Mr. Fielding and Howard escorted by
            Jones and our men, climbed to the top of the great pylon, and got a wonderful view of
            the country, which is beautiful here, the valley being wide and highly cultivated. But
            the strangest sight was the village that Page 79 lay spread out below and around us! It
            was much like looking into a great wasp’s nest, or busy ant hill. We left Nettie, Mr.
            Fielding and Howard at the little American Mission school that Mr. Fielding wanted to
            see, and the rest of us rode home through the narrow, rather clean streets of the town,
            across the canal bridge, and through the pleasant fields back to the boat. I was much
            amused at the description Howard gave me of the visit to the school - afterward
            confirmed by Nettie with greater detail. It seems school hours were over, but two or
            three scholars lingering about, the school master wished to show their English and
            begging them not to dismount, called the boys and made them read a portion of the old
            Testament choosing or falling upon a very uninstructive chapter, which as Howard said
            “was not above deck”. Our poor victims sat through it as long as they could, and then
            broke away. We left Edfou while we were lunching and are now at El Kab, 13-1/2 miles
            from Edfou - making the days run 25-1/2 miles. The evening is radiantly beautiful - and
            the “Kitty” is lying just in front of us - deserted except by her Captain and one or two
            men - Mr. Tylor and Somers-Clarke being up on the mountain where we are going to see
            them tomorrow. Feb. 16th. Immediately after breakfast we took some very wretched little
            donkeys, and rode out to the mountains to see the tombs, and to see Mr. Tylor and his
            friend who are encamped there making drawings and excavations. A lot of workmen were
            making a great deal of dust as we climbed the path and surprised Mr. Tylor in the midst
            of them. We had never seen Page 80 El Kab before, and were delighted. These tombs date
            from the last of the Hyksos, or soon after their rule - and were built by members of a
            noble family and show the same picture of ancient domestic life that the Beni Hassan and
            Sakkarah tombs do - the same “Threshing Song” or “Song of the Oxen” appears here too. We
            climbed from one to another, under convey of Mr. Tylor and then went to the tomb he
            temporarily occupies, quite a comfortable large rock tomb, with a good high ceiling -
            the shaft at the back of this appartment, which leads down to the real tomb was well
            covered with boards, and disguised with mattings and luggage - a comfortable camp bed,
            one or two chairs - a table, a lot of shelves rigged up - books, photographs etc. made
            it look quite homelike - the door was protected by a mosquito netting, and an inside
            curtain - revolvers and rifle near the bed - a tub and washing things. The large table
            was covered with drawing and photographing things - and Mr. Tylor showed us the
            beautiful reproductions he was making of the sculptures and inscriptions - a combined
            process of photography and pencil drawing most interesting and exquisite. He gave us
            coffee, and to me a little vase and cup, such as he finds in the tombs he excavates. The
            tomb next to this is used as a kitchen - and the one next to that by Mr. Somers-Clarke
            and was, as Mr. Tylor said quite “swagger”. Near this, almost slipping down the mountain
            side, was a little tent, used as a dining room. Mr. S.-C. was off at the temple of
            Amenophis, of which he is making drawings - so we did not see him. The view from this
            ledge of tombs is wide and beautiful. Mr. Tylor says they find this life charming - the
            climate so fine, and the tombs quite warm at night - and cool Page 81 during the heat of
            the day. Mr. Fielding and Howard with Jones, rode on to the temple an hour away and saw
            Mr. Somers-Clarke - but we returned to explore the ancient fortress or walled town,
            which is very curious. The walls are still in very good preservation and tremendously
            thick, being indeed 37 feet in thickness - made of large mud bricks - it encloses a
            square of which the sides are over 700 ft. in length. It was filled with such delightful
            looking heaps of rubbish, that Nettie and I were anxious to do a little grubbing, but
            the heat of the sun was intense - and we were thankful to reach the shelter and
            cleanliness of the dahabeah. We were off at a little past one o’clock and reached Esneh,
            where we are now lying at 9 o’clock - 17-1/2 miles, the men having rowed hard to make it
            as there was no wind until 5 o’clock when a light one came to our relief. Here we must
            stay until day after tomorrow to bake bread. Feb. 17th. Esneh. We are lying in a very
            pleasant place, quite away from the noisy part of the landing, and under the shade of
            some fine lebbek trees - and very near what used to be a palace of Mehemet Ali, in a
            large walled garden - with beautiful trees and shrubberies. It is now one of the
            Government schools. When we all walked into the town this morning on our way to the
            temple (which is Ptolemaic, and though of noble proportions and very interesting - being
            in fact only a hypostyle built by one of the Ptolemies to a temple of the 18 dynasty
            which now lies under the modern town, and has never been excavated, and to Page 82 which
            you have to descend by a long steep flight of wooden stairs) we were accosted by two or
            three Egyptian boys, and a young Capt. of 20 or 22 years, very well dressed, and with
            good manners; they apologized for speaking and said in very bookish language, that they
            took every opportunity of speaking English with travellers, to improve their own
            English. They went everywhere with us, and said they were scholars at the Gov. school
            near us. We invited them to come to the dahabeah for afternoon tea. Soon after lunch
            Nettie and I went up to the school, and finding the Master walking in scholarly fashion
            under the trees conning a book, we asked if we could see the school - he said school
            hours were over, but he would be glad to show us the building. It was a vasty old place,
            with some attempt at oriental magnificence, which years have rendered very shabby. We
            were shown the old baths, which with their inlaid marbles must once have been very fine
            - but about which an evil smell now clings. The rooms were full of good forms -
            blackboards - excellent object lessons - books etc. and the Master spoke good English
            which he had learned at Miss Whately’s school at Cairo. Soon after we got home the boys
            arrived - very shy but interested in everything - we had quite an elaborate tea - they
            at first declined anything, and then accepted everything. We afterwards brought them
            down stairs, and showed them the boat, and photographs and Nettie and Mr. Fielding sang
            and played for them. They seemed quite happy and were full of thanks, and gave us their
            names and addresses, and we gave them ours, promising to send them some English books
            and papers. Page 83 Feb. 18. Another day of strong head wind - we started at 7 o’clock
            this morning and floating and rowing have made only 6 miles. We tied up early in the
            afternoon, and Theodore, Howard and Jones and Mohammed Salah, took their guns and went
            ashore and Nettie and I with Mr. Fielding and some of the men went for a walk along the
            high bank above the dry bed of one of the irrigating canals. It was pleasant to overlook
            so pleasant a country - blossoming crops - and wide stretches of the greenest wheat and
            barley - the latter almost in full head. Here and there under the protection of walls of
            dry corn and dhourra stalks, were cattle and sheep and goats - all trying to get into
            the shade, and out of the wind. In one place a clean, thin, kind looking woman came out
            from a group of little huts and spoke to one of our men. I supposed of course she wanted
            baksheesh but he said no, she wanted something for her eyes which were very bad - and
            looking at them, I saw they were very bad - so I made her understand that she was to
            come to the boat with me, and I would give her something. I gave her one of the big
            bottles of eye lotion that Dr. Sandwith had advised our bringing - and I also gave her
            an orange and some fruit, for which the nice creature seemed so grateful - kissing my
            hand over and over, with many thanks and blessings. Feb. 19th. Quadragesima Sunday. A
            repetition of yesterday - only that we have made one less mile. We started at 5 - rowing
            until 8 o’clock - then tied up to wait Page 84 for the wind to lull. It has been a very
            pleasant day to me. Late in the afternoon Nettie and I, and Howard, leaving Mr. Davis
            and Fielding at their chess, went up the bank, and through the pleasant fields, and
            across the bed of the canal into the desert and almost to the foot of the hills - how
            strange and lonely and fascinating it was! and what beautiful lights and colours
            everywhere. I had a long talk with Salah about his people, and we were almost home,
            having hurried along as we saw the wind was rising, when we were met by little Ali and
            another sailor who said the Reis was waiting to go off, but we no sooner had started
            then it fell again - the young moon however now gives quite a light, and the Reis is
            determined to push on into the night as far as he can. Salah says he will go as far as
            Erment, 15 miles away. Feb. 20. Luxor. I heard the men at their oars all the night
            through whenever I wakened, until about 4 o’clock we pulled up, and great was my
            astonishment when I opened my window quite early to find we were lying at our old place
            at the Gezireh opposite Luxor - and we heartily congratulated our poor tired men on
            their nights work and promised them a sheep. We went over soon after breakfast to visit
            the hotel and read the latest telegrams, and to get certain things, and then Theodore
            and I went to old Mohammed Mohassibs. The blue rhinoceros that we saw as we went up, and
            for which he asked the enormous sum of £100 he sold to the Russian Prince Lottykof - who
            is enormously rich, and has an American wife, said to have been a variety singer - who
            is certainly very Page 85 pretty - for we have seen her on various occasions. They have
            the biggest and finest dahabeah on the river, and have been near us several times. In
            the afternoon we crossed in our felucca, and rode over to Karnac and had a charming
            visit. Feb. 24th. We left this morning most reluctantly, feeling that we could give no
            more time to it. It was hard to say goodbye to fascinating familiar landmarks. We have
            had four lovely days here. On Wednesday we went over to Medinet Habou soon after
            breakfast, leaving Theodore and Fielding as usual, glued to their chess board. They were
            to follow us later, but it was almost one o’clock when they arrived, and lunch was
            ready. Salah had prepared his table in one corner of the great hypostyle hall, but we
            found it so draughty, that, thinking of Theodore’s cold, we went searching about for a
            better place - and pitched upon one of the side rooms at the back of the older portion
            of the temple - and here we ate it, sheltered from the wind, and partially from the sun,
            while little Zenobia, or was it Fatima, I always mix those two children, waited
            patiently with her goolah. Most of the roofing of this room was gone - only one great
            architrave remaining, on which was sculptured a row of such delightful cynocephalus
            apes, that with the help of some of our men, I clambered up a ruinous staircase and
            photographed them, though the light and position were not all I could have wished. Then
            I photographed Zenobia, and some parts of the temple. We had feared that we would meet
            gangs of tourists, for 3 Cooks boats were in, and Page 86 one Gage steamer - but
            fortunately most of them had gone in the other direction, to the Tombs of the Kings etc.
            so that we had this grand, most interesting temple quite to ourselves. Here, as
            everywhere else, great numbers of Arabs were busy excavating, digging into the great
            mounds of brick and rubbish, which had filled and overflowed the temple enclosure and
            walls. They were at work on the span between the Pavilion and the temple proper - I saw
            the Pavilion more thoroughly than I have ever seen it. When the heat of the day was on
            the wane, Theodore, Nettie and I rode over to Der el Bahari - the others going home and
            across to Luxor for something. There is no spot about Luxor so fascinating to me as this
            temple of the great Hatasu - or Hatshepsu, as it is getting to be the fashion to call
            her. The spot chosen for it is so unique - in a cul-de-sac of the great yellow cliffs,
            which tower sheer above it in fantastic forms until they meet the blue sky. The
            imagination supplies the magnificent approach that once led to it from the river, across
            the plain and up to its level in a series of terraces - with its obelisks and avenues of
            sphynxes. The sculptured paintings on what is left of this temple are so beautiful and
            curious, that one never tires of looking at them. All the weary, never ending kings
            offering to Gods - all the array of Isises, Horuses, Khnums, Khonsus, Anubises, and the
            like, give place to cheerful portrayal of life and its occupations - and the minute
            history of Hatshepsut’s famous expedition to the land of Punt, and its return. The ships
            laden with spoil - the processions with strange animals and foreign trees and shrubs,
            are charmingly painted. One of the great features of the place, is the wonderful view
            from the upper Page 87 terrace, looking down that valley of desert desolation, to the
            radiantly green plain - to the river, with the houses of Luxor on the opposite bank,
            backed by the cultivated fields and palm trees, and the yellow cliffs beyond. With the
            exception of the houses of Luxor, the scene must have been much the same as in the days
            of Hatshepsu. The temples of Gurneh and the Ramesseum were not then built, but they are
            in such utter ruin that they do not now form special features in the plain from this
            height. The temple of Amenophis III before which stood the Colossi was not in existence,
            and not a vestige of it remains, though the Colossi still sit in battered existence -
            neither was Medinet Habou built - but over in Thebes the great Karnac was standing
            though not as we know it with the gigantic hall of columns of Seti Ist, but the older
            temple of the Thotmes stood, with Hatshepsu’s splendid obelisks, almost in a line with
            her temple here in Der el-Bahari - what a splendour it must have been! There is great
            excavating going on here, under M. Naville - and we came away half blinded and choked by
            the dust which the army of excavators were making - and I had my last favorite gallop
            across the green fragrant plain, and we arrived at home very hot and tired and glad to
            escape from the noisy donkey boys and the clamours for baksheesh into the cool quiet
            dahabeah, where tea was waiting, and the friendly samovar steaming its welcome. The
            temple of Luxor has been tremendously excavated, and is now most imposing and
            interesting - and the forest of papyrus columns which I have always thought one of the
            most beautiful sights of the river, has now been laid bare, to the bases of the columns.
            The great colonnade which was even more buried, has also Page 88 been entirely cleared,
            and adds immensely to the effect from the river. They are still very busy with the
            Rameses II end - have cleared away a great many native houses, and laid entirely bare
            one of the pylons and the sitting Colossus - down upon which you look from the height of
            the street opposite. The mosque still stands on the untouched ground, but that will soon
            be removed and the other pylon and colossus laid bare, the head of which now only shows.
            This work in Upper Egypt is all being conducted by the Ghizeh Museum, and is of immense
            value. Here at Luxor there are several lines of little tramways, with iron dumping cars,
            which dump the earth over the river bank, adding much to its improvement. We were at the
            temple yesterday just as all the men stopped work for the noon reSt. What a busy hive it
            was! Mohammed’s friend and patron, the well known Russian M. Goliniescheff was at Luxor
            with is beautiful boat the Zet-el-Nil (Spirit of the Nile). He bought her two or three
            years ago, and has spent, so Mohammed says over £2000 on her since. M. Goliniescheff had
            invited Theodore to come and see her, and one morning as we were in our felucca,
            Theodore and I, stopped to make a visit. She was charmingly fitted up. The next day M.
            Goliniescheff returned the visit, bringing with him some photographs he had made of his
            boat. They have our old Reis Achmet, and some of our sailors. We had light north wind,
            or no wind during our four days at Luxor - and in spite of north wind today, we have
            made a fine run of 44-1/2 miles, and are now at Keneh, and will see Denderah tomorrow,
            which is just across the river. Page 89 Feb. 25. Theodore and I took Salah, Jones and my
            Mohammed and went into Keneh directly after breakfast, to look for a certain antiquity
            dealer M. Goliniescheff had told him about. I had the most charming donkey I have ever
            mounted - fleet and easy - a beautiful mouse colour with a black stripe along his back.
            The ride of about 2 miles along a fine high road, with people on foot, on camels, on
            donkeys and horses in the fresh fine morning air, was delightful. Keneh is a large,
            important town of over 15,000 inhabitants - and is as famous now as in ancient days for
            its pottery - jars and kullas, which are exported in enormous numbers. One of the most
            picturesque sights of the river from here down, being the native boats piled with these
            jars. At the time of the Mecca pilgrimage, Keneh is filled with pilgrims, as this is the
            starting point for caravans to Koser on the Red Sea, and other ports. We went through
            most devious ways and curious places, and I never have had such an insight into native
            ways of living. I dismounted four times to enter as many houses, and I could only wonder
            when I came away, that a pestilence was not always raging there. At one place we found
            some interesting things, for which Theodore bargained unsuccessfully at the time, but
            they were brought to the dahabeah this evening for final barter, and Theodore got them
            for much his own price. One of them was a curious alabaster pot in the form of a monkey
            clasping a small monkey in his arms, with the cartouche of Merenra of the 6th dynasty on
            his right arm - the figure about 5 inches high - the alabaster toned and worn with age.
            A gold ring with royal cartouche - a dagger with gold Page 90 ornaments - 2 inscribed
            cylinders - and some beads for me - all for £25 when 40 was at first demanded. We got
            home in time for an early lunch, and were again in our saddles for Denderah. I had my
            charming donkey of the morning “Telephone” and the ride would have been pleasant if it
            had not been so very very hot - and I wore my smoked goggles and veil. The first view of
            this temple is always distinctly offensive to me, with its cumbrous, heavy topped Hathor
            headed columns, but the rest is delightfully interesting because of its decorations. I
            thought I should have had a sunstroke coming home, which I did on a hard gallop. We are
            moored on the Denderah side this evening, the wind blowing so that we cannot move, the
            brilliant moon makes the night bright, and the air soft and pure. Mr. Fielding with
            Howard, and Salah and Jones have gone over to Keneh this evening. Feb. 26. 2d Sunday in
            Lent. We started at 6 A.M. the men rowing - wind from north. At Keneh the river makes an
            abrupt bend straight away to the West. It was very warm, and our men rowed until I felt
            quite unhappy about them - then we drifted foolishly here and there, and bumped the bow
            in one bank and then the stern into the other bank, until as we came to the great Gebel
            at the bend of the river before reaching the town of Kasr-es-Saiyâd the wind became very
            fitful and Theodore and the rest taking a fancy to land for a walk, we stopped
            unfortunately to put them off and the men who were tracking could not hold the rope, and
            away we went waltzing into the stream - afterwards in pulling to the anchor for the
            opposite Page 91 shore, the anchor was lost - we put down another one, and are now lying
            in the stream while the men are out in two small boats searching for the anchor. It is
            vexatious to be detained in this fashion, the moon is so bright now, we might have gone
            on until late in the night. These brilliant nights are fascinating - and the transition
            effects from sunset to moonlight have a delicacy and beauty which must be seen, to be
            realized. Made 30 miles. Feb. 27. I found when I looked out of my window this morning,
            that we were still lying in the stream, and all through the night I heard the men in the
            boats, and the stir of movement on board - and M.S. told me they had had no rest -
            Theodore felt much annoyed at the delay, and after breakfast gave orders that he would
            not wait much longer, as the £3 which the Reis said the anchor was worth was much more
            than balanced by his daily expense of £9. But it was really after 12 o’clock before the
            Reis, whose fault it was for not buoying his anchor, called in his men, and gave up the
            search. The poor fellows looked tired enough, as in the hot sunshine they took up their
            big oars, and began to row us down stream again. We are now drawn up at a little village
            within 10 miles of Balliana, making 16 miles since we started at 12 o’clock. Feb. 28. We
            arrived at Balliana this morning, making the 10 miles by hard rowing. We caught up with
            a dahabeah which passed us yesterday, flying the French flag, but she did not stop - and
            one of the Cooks daha Page 92 beahs, the Ammon-Ra which we left at Assouan, overtook us
            and passed down, towed by a tug. The day has been extremely hot, the thermometer on
            Theodore’s shaded balcony marking 80 degrees - and 79° in the salon. We are now in a
            very rich country - the cultivated land being about 9 miles wide on this side of the
            river. Milner says that “Egypt as a geographical expression is two things - the Desert,
            and the Nile - as a habitable country it is only the Nile”. The river is now running
            down very fast - the banks are much higher than when we went up - and many sand banks
            are showing themselves, from the size of a mere patch to long stretches. The fellaheen
            have a way of planting corn stalks in the low water whether to mark a certain kind of
            crop he intends to plant, or to preempt as it were the newly fertilized ground, I do not
            know. The moist stretches of ground from which the water has just receded, leaving its
            rich deposit, are being planted with water melons - the bean crops are 3 and 4 feet
            high, and the rich crops of barley and wheat are in head - through these, here and there
            are little mud elevations like a huge barrel, from which a watch is kept against
            depredations of birds, or man. Their agricultural implements are very crude - a wooden
            hoe, shaped something like a crescent with coarse teeth, ploughs of most primitive
            description. But given the necessary irrigation, nature is so beneficent here, that no
            hard culture is needed. I saw some time ago, a cow and a calf, pulling a plough, side by
            side, and quite 12 feet apart. The condition of the fellah, since the evil days of
            Ismail, and especially since the English occupation, is so improved that considering the
            simplicity of his wants, the amenities Page 93 of the climate, and the easy culture of
            the land, he is more comfortable and happy than the peasantry of other countries. The
            Kourbash and the carver banished, and his taxes lessened, and the contstant improvement
            of irrigation methods, have made his life quite another thing. The agriculture of the
            land is in the hands of the fellah - and they compose about 4/5 of the population. Few
            of them, it is said, suffer from real poverty - many of them are the proprieters of the
            lands they cultivate and the many public works now carried on, give employment to the
            poorest. They are a cheerful, good natured people - honest to a certain degree - apt to
            quick passion, which however seldom reaches violence, and very superstitious. They seem
            entirely lacking in independence - and have absolutely no initiative - they must have
            some one to lead and guide them - hence the English officers in their army are a real
            necessity. They are devoted to Islamism - and under evil influences are ready to burst
            into fanaticism. I suppose it is impossible for us to realize the contempt with which
            they regard all foreigners and Christians. We know ourselves to be so much superior,
            that it is difficult to believe that they can consider us with anything like contempt.
            The two races and civilizations stand so far apart, that however friendly we may be as
            individuals we cannot understand each other. We have often remarked upon their curious
            dullness of the senses - their preceptions and sensibilities are not keen - they seem
            almost indifferent to pain and physical discomfort. I think they are like children and
            animals - they do not suffer from imagination, which makes half of our suffering. They
            never seem able to divide their attention between two objects, which is Page 94 so
            natural to us. If you wish to speak to them, it is quite impossible to attract their
            attention if they are speaking to some one else, or watching something, or engaged in
            their own thoughts. Theodore not being well, and I not wanting to take the long ride to
            Abydos in the heat, we stayed at home, the rest starting after an early lunch at 12
            o’clock. They reported it very hot going out, but very pleasant coming back in the
            bright moonlight. March 1st. We passed Girgeh this morning at 10 o’clock - then
            Mensheyeh, and pulled up at Akhmim at 4 o’clock for the night - having made 27-1/2
            miles, with little or no wind. Theodore had resolved on the way up to stop here as we
            came down, and had been told of some valuable things he could find here. We are lying
            just above the town, and rowed down immediately in the felucca and walked into the town
            - found it very interesting and more nearly approaching the picturesque than anything I
            have seen along the Nile. Salah was affectionately welcomed by many people - though this
            is not a tourist’s town, but he has been here several times with M. Goliescheff. We went
            into a very good house, but found nothing we wanted - most of the things being Coptic.
            We rowed back to the boat through the glory of the most beautiful sunset I ever saw - a
            mingling of sunset and moonrise. Just as I was dressing for dinner Theodore knocked at
            my door to tell me that a large dealer in the town had come to the boat to speak to
            Salah, and to say that he would send two donkeys for this evening to go to his house -
            and that I was to Page 95 dress for the expedition. So after dinner, taking Salah and
            Jones and my Mohammed, Theodore and I went up the bank and found a man on a donkey with
            2 fine donkeys waiting for us - and we set forth in the beautiful moonlight. Instead of
            going into the town we had seen in the afternoon, we turned away from it to another part
            which lies beyond the ruins of the old temple. Akhmim is built upon the site of ancient
            Khemmis which disputes with This-Abydos for the oldest town in Egypt. But little can be
            seen of the ancient buildings. A great necropolis from which hundreds of mummies have
            been taken, was discovered in 1884, by Maspero. We first took our way for a long
            distance through a broad kind of an avenue with high walls on either side, overhung with
            palm trees, through which the full moon looked down upon us, then through a scattered
            palm forest, when we came to the necropolis with its mounds of rubbish and yawning
            chasms, and up and down we went through this ancient burying ground with its occasional
            little mosques glimmering in their whiteness, until we came to the ruins of the old
            temple past which we rode, and on for some distance, until we came to a town clean
            looking, and with rather important houses on either side its narrow streets - before we
            entered it a guard, well armed, joined us - we passed a group of men sitting at the
            gate, and I don’t think we saw another being, until we stopped before a new, large and
            quite handsome house, the owner of which Salah said, had made all his money in
            antiquities. Here we dismounted and were conducted through the court to a large room,
            well lighted and furnished, with glass cases about, containing the collection - and here
            we stayed for more than an hour, and although we were disappointed Page 96 in what we
            saw, Theodore brought away a few very interesting things, for which he paid £15, £40
            being first asked. There were some beautiful carvings in stone - but these were too big
            and too heavy for us to think of buying. When we came out of the house, we found several
            men had gathered about - and I had mounted, when Theodore and Salah were called back to
            look at something, and I waited for them. One of the men came up to me and tried by
            gesticulation and words to make me understand him - raising his eyes again and again to
            heaven - then he rushed into the house and was back again in a moment saying to me with
            the greatest delight, “Jesus loves me” “I am Christian”! and I smiled and said goodbye,
            leaving him very pleased. What a delicious ride home that was, the air was so soft. I
            had only a light wrap - the splendid moon - the weirdness of it all - the silence - the
            occasional barking of a dog, or a challenge from our guard. We said goodbye when we
            reached the bank to our kind people, with thanks for the donkeys and the pleasant
            experience, and climbed down into our boat. March 2d. We passed Sohag quite early this
            morning and have come to within 2 miles of Tahtah, making again 27 miles, in spite of
            the wind. We are lying in a lovely spot near the great Gebel Shêkh el-Harfdeh, at the
            foot of some very high cliffs, and at their base a group of palm trees which are waving
            and rustling their great plumes above us, while the moon is radiantly beautiful. We have
            been sitting on deck all the evening, - I in thin stockings and slippers - the day has
            been very warm. March 3d. Passed Tahtah early this morning - and then Gou-Aboutig, and
            brought up at the little Gezireh opposite Assiout about 6 o’clock in the evening -
            having made a fine run of 44 miles. Howard and Salah immediately went into the town for
            our mail. The day has been very still of course to have allowed us to make such progress
            and very warm. Mercury on the back balcony went up to 87°. We had an awning on deck, and
            I sat there most of the day. I do revel in the special beauty of these hot Nile days -
            the placidity of the river - the yellow of the cliffs - with their soft pink tinges
            reflected in the water - the brilliant green cultivated land - the whole thing dissolved
            in soft opalescent tints - and the hush of peace everywhere. We are now in one of the
            widest and richest of the Nile valleys - the wheat is high and luxuriant, and the barley
            in beard - and masses of soft scent trees give the country a park like effect. March 5.
            3d Sunday in Lent. We stayed all day in Assiout yesterday. I went into the bazaar with
            them all, and found it very warm and the sun tremendously bright, so that after going to
            the telegraph and P.O. Theodore walked home. In the afternoon I stayed at home, and not
            having the courage to face the blaze and heat again, the rest rode out through the town
            to the mountain to see the tombs, which are not interesting - the view however is
            superb. We started early this morning, but the wind was so violent we tied up under the
            shelter of a high bank for 4 hours - and the awnings were Page 98 stretched to protect
            us from the wind - but it was a delicious pure air and I felt it so life-giving that I
            stayed on deck most of the day. Theodore gave the men the usual sheep at Assiout, and we
            brought a nice fat little fellow along in the small boat. I was pleased to see him
            released from captivity as we drew up, and when I was called below to luncheon, I left
            him merrily nibbling at the herbage on the bank - I went on deck again immediately after
            luncheon and to my horror way his brown hide stretched to dry almost on the identical
            spot where I left him cropping the grass - and his body hanging at the cook’s larder.
            What an example of the transitoriness of life! We moved away late this afternoon, after
            the wind lulled, and had got well out into the stream, when it was discovered that we
            had left one of our sailors behind us - and sending the small boat off, he was found
            asleep in the young wheat. We are now about 10 o’clock anchored in the stream opposite
            Manfaloot thus making 26 miles. The moon was so bright the men were able to row later. I
            have just finished reading Peter Ibbotson for the second time. The first time I read it,
            I was so touched and enamoured with it, that I thought I might have overrated it - but
            there is the same charm about it - which though rather difficult to put into words, is
            none the less potent. It is a venture to attempt explanation of the mystery of the other
            life, and of the heart breaking separation that divides one loving soul from another at
            death. That he touches upon truthful possibilities and that if we cultivated our
            spiritual instincts more assiduously we might bridge over some of the dark places that
            divide the natural and spiritual, I think no one will deny. Page 99 March 6. We made 10
            miles this morning by 11 o’clock - when coming within a mile of two of the great Gebel
            Aboufoydah, and the wind increasing, that we pulled up to the sand bank opposite the
            great cliffs, almost at the same place where we spent a day and night in a great
            sandstorm two years ago - when Mr. Chester and his friend who were also laid by, came
            over and spent the day with us. I have been beautifully busy about all sorts of things
            today. Theodore, Nettie, Howard and Mr. Fielding, accompanied by the inevitable Jones
            and Salah, went out with their funs [sic; guns] for some sport - but brought nothing
            back. They reported it very windy and hot, as I found myself, in strolling along the
            bank looking at some fellaheen planting water melons. This evening the men gave a
            regular jamboree - dancing and singing - in curious costumes - and were very merry.
            March 7th. We have made a fine run today starting at 6 A.M. for the first time since we
            left Assouan, we unfurled our sails with the exception of one day, when we were making a
            difficult landing. For 2 hours we came along finely with a gentle breeze, when it drew
            ahead again, and the sails had to be furled. We passed Tel el-Amarna, where we had
            intended stopping, but not liking to interrupt such unusual progress, we kept on, and at
            5 o’clock pulled up at Rhodah, where most of them went ashore for a walk and an
            inspection of the sugar factory - and we floated down past the factory and below the
            village and tied up - such Page 100 a soft brilliant sunset! Camels and cattle - people
            and flocks all going home along the path at the top of the bank, making black
            silhouettes of themselves against the crimson gold of the sky. They all came home with
            their guns. Salah and one of the men carrying one of the huge baskets, which are always
            so engaging - and such pretty masses of colour, fresh lettuce and tomatoes, oranges and
            lemons, and bunches of pink roses and buds. Made 30 miles. March 8th. We drew up to Beni
            Hassan this morning at 7 o’clock and I was at once awakened as every one else on the
            boat must have been by the clamour of the donkey boys. We were off for the mountains
            soon after breakfast - the sun very hot, but a cool delicious wind blowing that made it
            tolerable. We went first to the Speos Artimedos, which I did not see before - and which
            is well worth a visit - then to the well known tombs up on the mountain. These tombs
            have been much cleared of rubbish and protected since we saw them last and we found the
            public regulations greatly improved and we were a much more quiet and orderly party with
            no following of noisy natives fighting with themselves and the officers. We had one well
            mounted police officer only today. We stopped after seeing the tombs to look at the wide
            view beneath and about us - showing so plainly the absolute dividing line of desert and
            cultivated land - then finding a good south wind blowing, we hurried back to the boat,
            which had dropped down the stream a distance, the plank was immediately drawn in and we
            were off, at one o’clock. How cool and quiet the cabin seemed Page 101 and how
            appetizing the lunch table looked with its bottles of beer and mineral waters and the
            fragrant big dish of salad, that Salah is famous for - tomatoes - lettuce - and the
            silvery delicate young Egyptian onion! We reached about 5 o’clock having made 25-1/2
            miles - we are lingering over these last days of our voyage - our rooms at Shephards are
            engaged for the 22d so that we have time enough and no inclination to get back to Cairo
            and civilization. March 9th. We have made quite 25 miles today, and are now 2 or 3 miles
            below Colossaneh. It has been a remarkable day. A very cloudy morning ushered in a day
            of very strong fitful wind - and this afternoon everything became so threatening, that
            we felt we must be going to have a tempest - and presently Howard exclaimed, “the sand
            is coming behind us” and sure enough it was - in a whirl that blotted out trees and
            mountains, and lashed the river into yeasty waves. Everything was carried below in a
            jiffy - wraps, books, glasses, writing materials and all the parphernalia with which we
            burden the deck every day - rugs were snatched up - and chairs laid down. Theodore and
            Mr. Fielding even forsook the chess board to which they are usually glued, and rushed to
            see what the matter was. We let our anchor go, and waited to see what the storm would
            come to - in half an hour it began raining, and rained quite smartly. But before the sun
            set, it was quite clear again, and the freshly washed air quite delicious. I went on
            deck while every one else had forsaken it, but finding it still damp and wet, was going
            down again when Jones brought Page 102 a dry thick rug for the floor, and an easy chair
            and my big cloak, and I sat snugly comfortable until it was time to go below and dress
            for dinner. March 10th. When I first looked out of my window this morning, the mist was
            driving and rolling from off the river, giving a most curious effect - showing how much
            colder it was than usual - and I shivered through my dressing. We had been under way for
            some time, and had passed Abou Girgeh - and by 11 o’clock were pulling up to Maghaghah,
            where we were to post letters, get out mail, and a box of Apollinaris waiting for us,
            which had been sent on from Cairo. Theodore called out to me that they were going to
            walk into town, so I left my letters which I had been impatiently writing all the
            morning, and hurried off with them. The morning was delicious - and we enjoyed our walk,
            the town quite pretty, with the inevitable sugar factory and railway. A small canal with
            pollard willows on either side led through part of the town, looking quite English and
            very pleasant. We went through the market square, and to the very good little railway
            station and then to the river by another way - the canal and willows skirting a meadow
            with cottages and little gardens opposite. A number of Europeans live here - and we
            stopped at a neat little house, its verandah covered with vines, and the little garden
            bright with flowers, to compliment the comely Scotch body, who sat on the verandah, on
            her flowers. Her husband, a Scotch engineer of one of the factories came out and was
            very friendly - giving me some white Page 103 roses and gilly flowers. We have come
            along gaily under our sails today, and pulled up at 7 o’clock at Benisoef, having made
            58-1/2 miles. For days we have been passing through the pigeon country, all the towns
            have the houses crowned with the curious pigeon towers - looking like pylons - and the
            pigeons swarm and circle in the air. March 11th. Did not start until 7 o’clock - morning
            cold and thick with gale from the South - made only 3 miles, stopping at an interesting
            looking Coptic Der, or Convent, into which we found we could not enter, as the two
            inmates had gone over to Benisoef, and taken the key with them. We then went a little
            farther and attempted to land on the lee bank, the wind being very stiff, but we brought
            up with a slight bump upon some rocks - and so put out in the stream again and made for
            the other shore. March 12. 4th Sunday in Lent. We passed Zawieh early this morning, and
            came on to Wastah 4 miles below, where we are now lying - making 10 miles - intending to
            visit the pyramid of Medûm. I was not feeling very well this A.M. and did not like the
            long ride in the sun - so stayed at home - and had a busy quiet day. The dahabeah “Eva”
            flying the American flag, with a Mr. and Mrs. Goddard, is lying near us. Such a
            laughable scene occurred this afternoon. I had walked to the end of the deck looking at
            a native boat, with its cargo of men and women, donkeys and horses making a land Page
            104 ing next us. A very large camel was on board, and was the very last thing to attempt
            landing, the men holding him by the bridle, made a motion to encourage him to make his
            jump over the low side of the boat but the camel declined and and suddenly turning
            jumped into the river pulling the man with him, and began making for the opposite shore
            - when the man emerged from his unexpected plunge, he clambered on the camel’s back and
            shouted for help - some of our men jumped into the felucca, and went out to his rescue,
            and finally succeeded in towing the camel in - but when he reached shallow water, he
            laid down on his side and for sometime refused to move. I am sure he had a good reason
            for such behavior. Which reminds me that yesterday that Nettie and I and Mr. Fielding
            started for a walk, and struck across the country to a canal embankment we saw - from
            which we looked over wide fields of grain - the barley well bearded, and the wheat
            almost as far advanced - and here and there the little cleared spaces for the flocks -
            which always give such a pleasant aspect to Egyptian fields - with their little groups
            of animals and men - looking almost like appartments. At one place we came upon one of
            these with a dozen or more camels feeding, with 3 very young camels - skipping and
            playing about - and anything more ludicrous and awkward than their gambols, I have never
            seen - they suggested very, very huge Grand-daddy-long-legs in sportive humour. I
            thought it a good chance to get some camels milk, which I have been wanting to try, but
            have never been able to get - so after a great mix of English and Arabic words and many
            gesticulations we succeeded in making them understand what we wanted - they said “aiwah”
            so we sent one of our men back Page 105 to the boat for a pitcher - but after that came
            it proved very difficult to make the camel give down her milk - but we did get a little,
            and very delicious and delicate it was. I have been reading for the second time, Lady
            Duff Gordon’s “Last Letters from Egypt”. They are very charming - quite aside from their
            literary merit, which is great. The entire self forgetfulness that made her strong
            enough to come and spend her last suffering years in a strange land, and to throw
            herself heartily and helpfully into the lives and interests of the people about her, is
            very lovely. There is such noble, catholic sympathy in every page of her letters, that
            it makes one serene to read them. I should like to have known the old Sheik Yussef - her
            familiar friend and adviser at Luxor. I asked our old Mohammed Mohassib one day at
            Luxor, if he were still living. “No”, he said, “he died last year - he was a great good
            man - but he has a son now living here”. In her last letter to her husband, written a
            month before she died, she urges him as he had not been well, not to attempt coming to
            Egypt - for, she says “it would be too painful for me to part with you again; and as it
            is, I can wait patiently for the end among people who are kind and loving enough to be
            comfortable, without too much feeling of the pain of parting”. March 13th. This had been
            the worst day I have ever known in Egypt. We came about 4 miles from Wastah, but at 9
            o’clock the gale was so strong from the north, that Theodore gave orders to tie up, and
            we have not Page 106 stirred since, except as the violent wind has battered us about.
            There is really a heavy sea on - and the sun shines only fitfully from out the brown sky
            - and the sand flies, penetrating everywhere. A “raconteur” or wandering minstrel came
            along this morning, with a curious wooden musical instrument, with only 2 strings, which
            he played with a bow - something like an attenuated violincello - he brought out a
            wonderful variety of sound, and sang or recited in a very dramatic manner. Our sailors
            sitting about the deck, wrapped in their shawls, enjoyed it immensely. The afternoon was
            the dullest I have ever spent on the Nile. March 14. When I awakened this morning I
            heard the men at their oars, and at breakfast Mohammed said we had made about 14 miles.
            The morning was cool with a good many clouds hanging about, and last night, I heard it
            raining smartly, for a few moments. We were on deck soon after breakfast, glad enough to
            get out again. The Meydoum pyramid had disappeared from sight, but the Dashur pyramids
            and finally the Sakkarah came into sight. What tremendous things they are - especially
            seen from a distance - they then show their enormous size and dominate the country. As
            the morning wore on, the wind grew very cold, and drew out straight ahead, and after
            drifting about some time, we tied up near a pretty spot, where was a kind of cottage now
            deserted, and what had been a fine garden. After lunch we went up the bank, and walked
            about the garden, which was filled with young orange and lemon trees -and a great many
            pomegranites, now just coming into their new red and green foliage. Page 107 We found
            some superb thistles, with beautiful variegated leaves, making a very decorative plant -
            and a lot of small chicory flowers - quite like ours, but smaller and of a more
            branching habit. And Hassan found a green Mantis insect, which Jones took home. The air
            has been delicious today - so cool and grateful and fragrant. We have made today about
            25 miles - and are now lying below some lofty pines, within a few miles of Bedrasheyn,
            which we will reach tomorrow. The wind is at last quiet - and the night serene. March
            15th. Arrived at Bedrasheyn this morning early, making 10 miles - and directly after
            breakfast, started out to Memphis and Sakkarah. A more perfect day could not have been
            imagined - cool and a trifle cloudy it was quite perfect. Five years ago, on just such
            another morning I took that same charming ride - through the pleasant palm groves, and
            past the mud villages and across the fields, with their fragrant blossoming crops, and
            herds of cattle and sheep in their little camps, made by cutting down the crop for a
            space, and leaving the rest as enclosing walls. Then again into the palms, where lie the
            two colossal recumbent figures of Rameses II, and where we stopped to see what was not
            to be seen when we were here before, the excavations of the famous temple of Ptah, which
            has been lying for centuries under a magnificent grove of palms - it was curious to see
            the trees left in a huge ball of earth, perhaps for transplanting, and the ruined walls,
            columns, broken statues etc. - lying down below. The bases of the columns which are in
            place, are Page 108 truly colossal, and the carvings and inscriptions on them, and on
            the walls, are in beautiful style. We reached Mariette’s house just in time for lunch,
            which we had taken with us, and found two parties already lunching there. One of them
            was the Russian Prince Soltykoff with his dragoman, a crowd of servants - silver service
            - easy chairs - embroidered coverings, and I don’t know what all. His dragoman told
            Salah that he had quarelled with his pretty wife, and sent her back to Paris. He looked
            most lonely, a weak young fellow, and had a hollow cough. We walked about, and sat down
            on that long wide, covered verandah waiting for our lunch to be ready - and saw the
            departure of the English party, the arrival of a German group - and the getting under
            way of two or three camels, laden with the elaborate Soltykoff equipage - then after we
            had lunched, went to the Serapeum, and to the tomb of Ti, which is much better seen than
            formerly - a new roof now covers it, and a sky light which seems incongruous - but it
            affords protection, and enables one to see the fascinating interior, it is a beautiful
            work of the Ancient Empire. We lingered about in the desert, and rode leisurely home, in
            as roundabout a way as we could - for it was all so charming - earth, air, sky - and we
            felt it was our last expedition. We are lying in a beautiful spot - with the palms near
            us, with their fascinating perspectives, an English dahabeah near us. We intend crossing
            the river tomorrow for a day at Helouan. March 16th. I have passed the first dull day I
            ever had in Egypt! We went Page 109 over to Helouan this morning - a well known and much
            frequented health resort, with sulphur baths, lying in the desert. A dreary, ghastly
            looking place, with its bright staring new french houses, and hardly a tree or shrub.
            The late Khedive was very fond of this place, and indeed died there - and during his
            life time he discouraged all planting of trees and shrubs - believing the pure desert
            air contaminated by them. We lunched at the Khedival Hotel - a modern large, luxurious
            hotel, much superior in its fittings and arrangements to Shepheards. There were a lot of
            English people there - Mr. Fielding found some people he knew - and we were all glad to
            come away, and reach home, feeling the day had been quite wasted. I should so much
            rather have stayed - and wandered through the palms and enjoyed Bedrasheyn. March 17. We
            made 13 miles between our landing place of last night, and our present one here at
            Ghizeh - just opposite the entrance gates of the palace, which is now the museum. A
            strong North wind has been blowing all day, and we laid by two or three times, but about
            5 o’clock were able to pull off up here at Ghizeh. We went over to the palace at once,
            though it was past the museum hours, and went into the garden, and wandered about
            delightedly until almost dark, the air so soft, and the whole place to ourselves - with
            such superb, though eastern gardening - it seemed as if it might be fairyland. The
            minarets of Cairo seem almost opposite us - and we much congratulate ourselves on our
            position. The citadel with its slender minarets is a most striking fea Page 110 ture as
            you approach Cairo but as you get nearer the effect is much lost - and the impression of
            airy height much lessened. Salah went into Cairo tonight. March 18th. Salah came out on
            a donkey this morning early with a huge packet of letters and papers - having made an
            arrangement at Shepheards to supply us with carriages while we lie here. We had intended
            going over to the museum after breakfast, but Theodore wanted to go in town and see the
            rooms that had been reserved for us at Shepheards, and wanted me to go with him. We
            found a charming suite of rooms - but we do not want to take possession of them until
            the 22d. We went to some shops, and then gladly drove back to our beloved Herodotus. The
            day has been dull, and a very strong cold north wind blowing - and everybody in Cairo
            complaining of the unusual weather. After lunch Theodore, Fielding, Nettie and I went
            into the museum. Mrs. Davis and Howard electing to drive into town. We made the round of
            the ground floor rooms mostly. I am enormously impressed with the masterpieces of
            Ancient art, whenever I see them. Ra Hotep and his wife Nefert-Ari sitting
            affectionately side by side for thousands of years! and the two Ranofer statues - and
            the Sheik el-Beled - they all seemed wonderful again, especially the Ranofers. We were
            surprised and delighted to find two new statuettes of quite remarkable value, found at
            Memphis only two months ago of the 4-5th dynasty, one of them a sitting scribe - the
            finest thing I have seen in Egyptian art. It is a seated scribe - 51 centimeters high -
            of calcareous limestone - the flesh is tinted red, and the hair black - the eyes of
            quartz Page 111 with the lines of the eye lids in bronze - the modelling is fine - he
            holds a papyrus on his lap, and looks up from it with a serene, intent gaze, wonderful
            in its reality. It was found in a brick mastaba at Sakkarah. Then the wealth of stelae
            shown in that never ending succession of vast appartments - of such delightful interest,
            that one could spend months over them instead of hours. Nettie is absorbed over all
            these things and as interested as I could wish her to be. We could but glance at most of
            the curious monuments and treasures. We had intended going into the garden afterwards,
            but I was blind with fatigue and all of us very tired, so we went home for tea and rest.
            March 19th. 5th Sunday in Lent. The fast of Ramadan was ushered in last night by the
            firing of many guns from the Citadel - and all good Mohammedans now will neither eat or
            smoke until the evening gun tomorrow releases them from their fast, until the rising of
            the sun on the following morning. The effect of this fasting is said to be none of the
            best - as shown in irritability and sickness - excessive nightly feasting , following
            the day of fasting. Theodore, Nettie and I went to the Musuem this morning, the rest
            driving into church - but we found the Museum closed, and learned that from today, it
            will only open in the afternoons - so we divided our time between the garden and
            driving, and went back in the afternoon and spent all of it there. Tonight as the sunset
            gun was fired from the citadel, breaking the fast of the day, a great shout went up from
            the city, which we could plainly hear - with the noise of drums and music. Page 112
            There is always much noise and carousing and wickedness on Ramadan nights. All our men
            at once fell with alacrity on their evening meal which was ready and waiting for them.
            They all, with one or two not very honorable exceptions, keep the fast. Nose, the
            haughty, is one of the exceptions. Monday, March 20. Every time we have gone over to the
            garden, we have taken in with us two or three of our sailors - and they have so enjoyed
            it - passing the turnstile and seeing tickets bought for them - and the magnificence of
            the gardens, the fountains, the terraces, the little bridges over the islands, filled
            them with childish delight. So, before we started out to the Pyramids this morning, I
            told Salah to invite the whole crew, from the Captain to the Captain’s boy, to go over,
            and I gave Abbocato the entrance money. Mrs. Davis and I drove in the landau, the rest
            went on donkeys. We lunched at the Mena - a beautiful hotel, crowded with English
            people. We found Mr. Tylor, and Mr. Somers-Clarke there. After our visit to the Pyramids
            and Temple of the Sphynx we went back to the hotel and had tea on the terrace. The day
            has been disagreeable - a violent hot south wind blowing, sand flying, flies sticking.
            We were very glad to get home. Tonight is cloudy and threatening. We are so sad that the
            last days of our Nile life are running away so faSt. I bestow special caresses upon
            Mish-mish, and find her antics more and more beguiling - and I wonder after Salah takes
            her to his Cairo home, if she will not long for the happy Nile days and her Page 113
            river companions. We have already begun our packing - and tomorrow the dismantling will
            begin in earnest, alas! March 21. It has rained hard most of the day. We fussed and
            packed this morning and Nettie and I groaned and sighed every time we looked at each
            other. Soon after lunch we all went over to the Museum, driving in the rain. It was a
            free day, so we asked all the sailors to go with us. It was so interesting to see how
            they all took it. I think the vastness and splendor of the palace impressed them more,
            than all its treasures. They were transfixed with amazement in the great central hall,
            where all the royal and priestly mummies lie in their glass biers. Nose was so funny -
            after looking at one and then another he would look at me so sadly and stroke his head,
            as if he were saying, “this is too sad, take me away”. We have been having our last tea
            round the smoking samovar and we are so sorry, that we are just stupid and dull. March
            23. We are settled in a charming suite of rooms here at Shepheards quite at the opposite
            end of the house from that we were in before. The sitting room has a projecting corner
            window giving a pleasant outlook on the terraces below, and the busy life of the street.
            Most of the bed rooms lie on the garden side. My big one does, with a little balcony
            overlooking the lovely garden - and opening out of the sitting room. Page 114 Everybody
            growls about the weather and indeed it is extraordinary - for a week past it has been
            cold, windy, with frequent rains. We are a month later than we were before, yet I have
            never known it so cold here. We left the Herodotus yesterday morning - the final
            dismantling and farewells always so sad, were at last made, and we and most of our
            belongings were piled into Shepheards big omnibus, and left that pleasant life behind
            us. Some of our men have been up today to see us. We went to the bazaar this afternoon.
            March 24. Nettie, Howard and I went to three Mosques this morning - that of Sultan
            Hassan which I had seen before - that of Bardemt, small, exquisitely decorated -
            properly a Zawiya, I suppose, where prayers are daily offered, but no sermons preached.
            Then to Gami el-Muaiyad which was built 500 years ago, and is now being extensively and
            judiciously restored by a Society of Christians or foreigners, who look after ruinous
            architecture that is worth preserving - for no Musselman ever thinks of repairing
            anything. It is very beautiful. In the afternoon Nettie and I drove out on the Shubra,
            and saw a polo game for a little while, but we both agreed it was absurd to spend time
            in Cairo watching polo! Theodore is not well. Dr. Sandwith has seen him two or three
            times, and pronounces it liver. He is put on a diet, and ordered daily exercise on a
            donkey. Page 115 March 26. Palm Sunday. Weather is still extraordinarily cold - it is
            more like January than the end of March. Storms rage on the Mediterranean, and two of
            the passenger steamers could not make a landing at Alexandria last week and had to go on
            to Port Said. The Rubitino S.S. could not go out from Alexandria - and so on - We have
            had a fire in the little open stove in our sitting room for 3 days - and there has been
            one in the reading room downstairs every evening, a thing I never saw before. Dr.
            Wandwith [sic; Sandwith] who has been coming in often to see Theodore and who is
            extremely nice and interesting, and knows every thing about Egypt, was talking to me the
            other day about the hospital which is under his charge here, with a number of English
            nurses - and asked me if I would like to see it. Whereupon we arranged to go yesterday,
            and Nettie and I drove around to his office for him in the afternoon - and then drove
            almost out to old Cairo - passing the great gardens and palace of Ibrahim Pacha, an
            uncle of the young Khedive - and then the huge palace which belonged to his great
            grandmother, and where all her servants and retainers still live. The hospital is now
            what was formerly the Kasr el-Ain barracks, and is very large, in the form of a
            parallelogram - and has about 400 patients. Barren and comfortless as it is in many
            respects, it was clean, and had not a particle of hospital odour about it. There is a
            pleasant looking house within the walls, near thementrance [sic; the entrance] gate, but
            quite apart from the hospital, which is the home of the nurses. We were welcomed by Miss
            Bishop, who went about with us - a tall, fair, nice looking young woman, fresh as a
            rose. In all the Page 116 wards into which we went the windows were permanently taken
            out - which shows what this climate is. We saw one most extraordinary patient. The Dr.
            called her his phonograph. In her bed in a corner of one of the wards lay a very black
            woman - a Nubian - with her eyes closed, most of the time. She imitates every sound and
            movement she hears or sees - perfectly unconsciously - of course understanding no
            language but her own. Dr. Sandwith spoke to her in French, then in German, and English -
            she spoke in a low feeble voice, and with effort, as if she were moved by an invisible
            force. I raised my lorgnette to look at her, and she at once imitated the movement even
            to spreading 2 fingers, and peering at me through them. It was most curious. The most
            interesting thing I saw though, was a merry little black boy of about 4 years, clean and
            nice, who hung about Miss Bishop all the time, who was most affectionate with him. He
            went everywhere with us and she called him Jimmy, and he called her Sister. When I
            remarked upon his very attractive face, she said O! this our little prisoner of war, the
            son of the great Dervish general and Prince, Wad el-Nejenne, who was killed in the
            battle of Toski - this boy was found on the battle field, then only a baby of 6 months,
            and given into the charge of a Nubian woman and sent to Cairo by Gen. Grenfell, and
            committed to the care of the Sisters at the hospital. He is quite an important little
            personage, and may perhaps have a role to play in the future. Miss Bishop says the
            Soudanese often come to pay homage to him, and for a year or two, he was not allowed
            outside the walls of the hospital for fear he might be captured. He gravely drew himself
            up, when we came Page 117 away, and made the military salute. The contrast of his
            present and future life, with his origin, is very interesting. Before we left, Miss
            Bishop took us up to the roof of the hospital, which was quite flat without any
            projecting parapet or balustrade at the sides. It forms the exercise ground for the
            women, and it looked very curious as we drove away, to see those draped figures against
            the sky. We made the whole round of the building there, Jimmy frisking about us like a
            merry little dog. The view from it was charming - the island of Rhoda across the narrow
            arm of the Nile, just opposite - the Pyramids in the distance - the crowd of minarets -
            the wide extent of Cairo. It has been raining today much of the time. I stayed at home
            with Theodore this morning, and Howard and I went to afternoon service at 5. March 27.
            There are a lot of Indian dignitaries staying in the hotel. The Sultan of Jahore, who is
            very quiet and looks like a middle aged Englishman, and the Maharajah of Karpothalia,
            with their respective suites. The latter people are very Indiany - and though they wear
            European dress, always wear, indoors and out, big, magnificent turbans, exquisitely
            arranged. It is quite a sight to see them coming in to dinner, in the conventional
            evening dress, with their huge turbans - but it is still more of a sight to see them in
            the most extreme and correct English riding clothes, with pale blue, or rose coloured
            turbans. The other evening there was a ball, or dance - and they came out in wonderful
            attire. Nettie and I went into the bazaar this Page 118 morning with Salah and made some
            purchases - and this afternoon in spite of threatening weather, we went to the Tombs of
            the Khalifs, and the Mosque of Sultan Hassan. Nettie and Theodore on donkeys, the rest
            of us in the carriage. It poured with rain when we were coming back, and we had to take
            Nettie and Theodore in with us and all the streets made themselves into lakes and
            rivers. March 29th. Mr. Fielding has been staying for 2 or 3 days with some friends with
            whom he stayed before he went up the river, the Wilfrid Blunts. They have a place at the
            edge of the desert near Heliopolis. Mr. Blunt’s well known for certain eccentricities -
            a poet - some people think the greatest in England. He affects eastern culture, and has
            tried for some years to transform himself into an Arab - has built an Arab house
            furnished in Arab style etc. He was once imprisoned in England, for insurrectionary
            speeches to the Irish - and at another time, was requested by Lord Cromer to remain out
            of Egypt for a year, because of his sympathy in the Arab revolt. His wife is said to be
            very charming and gifted, and an excellent Arab scholar. She is Lady Anne Blunt,
            daughter of the Earl of Lovelace, and Ada, “sole daughter of my house”, the daughter of
            Lord Byron. They have one child - a girl - I suspect Fielding of a tender interest
            there. We were all invited out there one day - but thought it decent to decline as a
            party - but I made Theodore go. He reported the place and the people quite delightful,
            and out of the ordinary - and said Lady Anne was a sad-eyed woman, but the Page 119 most
            interesting he had ever met. Mr. Blunt breeds Arab horses - and they are all great
            riders. Miss Judith Blunt performs the Arab fantasia - brandishing the long pole, and
            managing her horse in Arab fashion. This morning we went to the great mosque of Thulun -
            I think it the most impressive sight in Cairo - then to the Gami el-Azhar - the famous
            college or university - with its great courts, and groups of students - children and men
            - squatting about with their books before them - some preparing food and others eating -
            some stretched out at full length asleep - grave gray bearded men sitting on the ground,
            looking as if they were filled with the mysterious wisdom of the East, and discoursing
            of occult things. Then we went to the Gami el-Hakkim now almost in ruins, and made into
            a kind of Arabian Museum. This afternoon we all went some on donkeys and the rest in the
            carriage to the tombs of the Mamelukes, and saw those, and the singular ones of the Vici
            Royal family. How strange they are in their curious shapes, crowded together in their
            queer rooms, with Brussels carpets on the floor, chintz curtains and covered divans and
            the sun looking cheerfully in through the red curtained windows. One almost expects to
            come upon a tea table with afternoon tea and cakes. Then we went up to the Citadel to
            the Mohamet Ali Mosque - beautiful with that view of the great city in its wide extent,
            with the glimmering Nile in the distance, and the distant form of the Pyramids. When we
            got home Mr. Fielding and I went for some photographs, and then he proposed going to the
            Ezbekieh Gardens for tea and to listen to the music - but we walked from spot to spot -
            deciding one was too shaded - another too Page 120 near the music etc. until we laughed
            and decided to go back to Shepheards garden, and have tea there. But the fates were
            against us, we could find no one to bring tea to the garden, so we were forced to go in
            and take it prosaically in our sitting room as usual. We have only one more day in
            Cairo, for we go on Friday the 31st to Alexandria, and take the P. & O. Cathay for
            Naples. March 30th. We are all packed and uncomfortable - ready for tomorrows start -
            with the exception of Mr. Fielding who will of course do most of his packing after the
            omnibus is driven to the door, with Jones to help - and all the servants - that is the
            usual procedure. We have had daily visits from most of our men - who generally station
            themselves across the street in the sunlight, and wait for some recognition from the
            windows - then they come over, and up to see us - faithful fellows - how we hate to
            leave them. One day on coming home, I found Ali, the Reis’s boy waiting, and I brought
            him in and upstairs in the elevator with me, to his excessive delight and astonishment.
            We have had 10 delightful days here - and I have seen a great deal of Cairo - at first
            the wretched crowds in the streets - the noise - the universal howling and shouting,
            oppress me, and irritate me - then I grow used to it, and finally fascinated. In our
            daily drives to the mosques and places of interest, what extraordinary quarters we
            found, and what streets we passed through - such glimpses through open portals of
            wonderful interiors - such facades - with their carved Mushrebeyahs, Page 121 or
            projecting windows of beautiful woodwork - the narrow streets over which tower minarets
            and domes - how very fascinating and lovely it all is! Naples. West End Hotel. April 6.
            Thursday morning. We left Cairo on the morning of Good Friday, 31 March. We brought
            Mohammed Salah to Alexandria and he took a tearful leave of us on the boat - we found
            the Cathay very comfortable - had pleasant passengers, and a smooth voyage across,
            arriving early on Tuesday morning. We left Theodore with Fielding and Jones to do the
            Custom House, and drove to the Grand Hotel where we had written for rooms - but they
            were crowded, and sent us here to their dépendence - which we find pleasant enough for a
            few days. It was formerly the old “Nobili” where I stayed years ago. On Tuesday
            afternoon all the rest went to Pompeii. Theodore and I went to the bankers and to some
            shops and for a drive over the colle to Posillipo - the wind very cold and strong, and
            the dust thick. Yesterday the rest went to Vesuvius and came home late, tired and white
            with dust. Theodore rested, and we took a drive and went to Capo de Monte, and through
            the large but uninteresting palace, and drove through the grounds - then about Naples.
            It is always so radiantly beautiful - where else can one see such grandeur of scenery,
            with such beauty of colouring. We are going to Monte Casino tomorrow, en route to Rome,
            to see the famous monastery. Fielding who has stayed there has written to ask if we
            could stay a night Page 122 and a day there - I have always looked at it with great
            curiosity, when passing it on the railway, away up on its airy height. Hotel du
            Quirinale Rome. April 8th. We were off from Naples yesterday at 9 o’clock in the
            morning, and reached Cassino at 11:30. We found two little carriages waiting for us, and
            were relieved to find that we would not, as Mr. Fielding thought, have to ride on mules.
            We had arranged to take up only our bags and some rugs, so that if we wished to spend
            the night we could. Jones went on to Rome with the luggage. Since Mr. Fielding was here
            a very good road has been made up the mountain by Government. We stopped a moment at the
            village to give the horses some water and I took a lot of photographs, of the people
            from the carriage. The views as we ascended were entrancing until as we got up to the
            level of the Monastery we could see the world below us - the rich valley of the
            Garigliano and the bold chain of the Abruzzi Mountains. After entering the walls, there
            is a short climb to the gate of the monastery where we found a big burly brother, his
            face purple with cold living and exposure, and who would hardly lift his eyes as
            Fielding talked to him. Then the Prior whom Fielding addressed as “mon Père” came to
            welcome us, a tall, spare dignified man, very shy with his French. We walked about on
            the magnificent terrace, which is supported by the columns dividing several courts
            below, affording wonderful views, and then into the church, rich and splendid, built in
            1727 on the site of Page 123 the one founded by St. Benedict - whose remains with those
            of his sister St. Scholastica, lie beneath the high altar. One of the large bronze doors
            of the church is inscribed with a list inlaid in silver of the possessions of the
            Monastery in 1066. We were then asked into a large bare room where a colazione was
            spread for us, which in our famished state was very acceptable, and we were not
            critical. The prior had said there was an American brother in the convent, whom he would
            send to us, and after our lunch there appeared a stout, jolly brother, whose name was
            Julian, and he proved to be a Pennsylvania dutchman, who did not speak the most polished
            English. He seemed overjoyed to see us, and welcomed us most fraternally as fellow
            Americans. This monastery of Monte Casino was founded by St. Benedict in 529 on the site
            of an ancient temple of Apollo. It now ranks as a “National Monument” and belongs to the
            Government, but still exists as an educational institution of theology. There are about
            30 monks and some lay brethren - and there are a telegraph office and printing office.
            Brother Julian proved to be an instructor in Hebrew and Philosophy in the school and
            under his kind but rather fussy care we went the rounds of the great courts and library
            - only we women were not allowed to go everywhere. The library was impressive - and
            seemed the very picture of a true mediaeval library - long and low and arched, with its
            windows in the deep embrasures of the enormously thick walls. I almost expected to see
            Romola and her white headed father there. These monks are the custodians of one of the
            most precious libraries in the world. The stately handsome manuscript rooms into which
            we next went, and where Page 124 we again met the Prior, hide behind their inlaid doors
            a famous mass of MSS. and the Archives hold a rare collection of documents - papal bulls
            - letters of emperors and kings etc. We were shown beautiful volumes - splendidly
            illustrated. Mrs. Davis and I with Fielding and Howard decided to stay over night - but
            Mr. Davis and Nettie went on to Rome by the afternoon train. Mrs. Davis and I would not
            be allowed of course to remain within the convent enclosure, so we went down to have a
            look at the little guest house outside the gates - called St. Agatha’s house - which
            though not luxurious was decently clean. Then Brother Julian turned us into the
            monastery garden running along one great wing of the convent - and we picked violets and
            daisies, and sat in the grass looking off into the wide valleys so far below us - when
            suddenly one of the under brothers appeared in breathless hurry to say we must come out
            at once, that no woman had ever been allowed there before, and gave us the impression
            that the end of the world was at hand, in consequence of our innocent transgression. So
            much disgruntled we withdrew our dangerous persons - and Brother Julian soon reappearing
            we told him. He seemed amused and perplexed by it - and in his simple, frank way,
            excused them - but it was very plain to see, from a very broad and higher ground - and I
            think the American brother disdained many of the restrictions and traditions of the
            monastery. We walked about with him for awhile, and as the convent gates closed at 6
            o’clock, and Fielding and Howard had to be within them at that hour, we said goodnight
            to Brother Julian, and the boys went down with Annie and me to St. Agatha’s for a few
            minutes. The house was kept Page 125 by an Italian peasant and his wife and daughter
            Marie - and being very hungry, we watched with some interest the preparations of our
            evening meal. The little table in the bare little room below was ready, but no supper
            arrived - when finally the old man appeared from the convent with very bulging pockets,
            and produced a loaf of dark bread from one, from another 4 eggs, which Marie took to the
            kitchen to cook, and we had something called coffee - that was all. The evening was
            dismal - and I went to bed at 9 o’clock, first hanging for a long time out of my window
            in the soft fresh mountain air - in front of which between the house and the edge of the
            cliff which fell sharply away, stood a tall young pear tree in densest white bloom,
            tossing its shadowing arms about - while a young crescent moon by the side of it made a
            decorative panel - and away down the mountain side, the valley lay in a white mist. I
            was up at half past 5 the next morning to see the dawn begin, and after dressing went
            down and sat in the sun outside the house to get warm - and I photographed Marie, the
            pretty daughter of the handsome old woman - and then the mother - and then a young woman
            who happened along - and a charming young donkey who was running about like a dog. After
            an impossible breakfast, which was a bad copy of the supper, we walked up to the
            monastery and joined Fielding and Howard - and said goodbye to the Prior and Brother
            Julian, and got into our little carriages, and clattered down the mountain, stopping at
            a ruined castle, and an ancient temple, and were soon on our way to Rome. Page 126 April
            19th. This is the 11th day of our stay here, and tomorrow we are off to Florence. It has
            not been very cheerful - for Theodore has been wretched, and for 2 days really ill. He
            is never well in Rome - I always detest this Hotel du Quirinale at which we are
            stopping: but we are fortunate to get good rooms anywhere, for Rome is now full, and
            people crowding in for the celebration for the silver wedding of the King and Queen of
            Italy. The German Emperor is coming tomorrow, I wanted really to see this cocky,
            energetic young Emperor. The streets are ablaze with colour and flags, and arches and
            tiers of temporary seats everywhere. It is a triumph for the King, and serves to offset
            the prestige of the Pope, with all the numerous pilgrimages which have been visiting
            Rome for weeks. Pope Leo XIII may be a sweet and venerable old man - but all the same he
            is foolishly sulking in his self-imposed martyrdom as a prisoner in the Vatican - and
            temporal power seems a thing forever vanished from papal hands. I immediately fall under
            the magical charm of everything in Rome, the moment I enter it - and though the changes
            are many - the charm remains - I have seen most of my old haunts. And we have had a
            great pleasure in seeing mediaeval art with fresh critical eyes - as the promising young
            art critic Bernhard Berenson has been stopping with us for two days. Theodore had been
            looking at a private art collection, the pictures of which were rather mysteriously
            offered for sale by its owner. When happening to mention it to Mr. Bliss, a friend of
            Fieldings, who has been for years the agent or envoy or something of the English Gov. at
            Page 127 the Vatican, he suggested, that from his knowledge of the Italians and their
            ways, he would advise Mr. Davis if he thought of buying, to have them examined by an
            expert. “Where shall I find one”, said Mr. Davis. Mr. Bliss advised writing to Mr.
            Berenson who was then in Florence, and asking him to come down for a look at them saying
            he probably knew as much if not more about Italian art than any man living. That he was
            born in America of Russian parents - graduated from Harvard, then gone to Oxford and
            Berlin and had made for years a special study of Italian art. So we wrote him, and he
            came and we have been going about with him and seeing for the first time with discerning
            eyes. For the first time I have seen the ravishing sweetness of the frescoes of Melozzo
            da Forli, who was the pupil of Piero della Francesca. These frescoes were painted in the
            dome of the church of S.S. Apostole, and were removed when some alterations were made -
            and are now in the Palazzo Quirinale, and the minor Sacristy of St. Peters, called the
            Stanza Capitolare. They are the most delicious things - almost modern and impressionist
            - and finely foreshortened. Melozzo was called the father of foreshortening. He died
            young and left nothing so far as I can find out but these, and a painting in the Vatican
            gallery, representing Sixtus IV and some cardinals. We had one charming morning at St.
            Peters, Mr. Berenson and I, wandering around the great church, talking of its history,
            of its builders, of its treasures, and finding the iron gates of the chapel of the Holy
            Sacrament open, they generally being closed, we went in to look at the beautiful and
            splendid tomb of Sixtus IV - 1484, built in bronze by Antonio Pollajuolo - brought from
            Page 128 the choir of old St. Peters where it was erected by his uncle the great Julius
            II, whose own tomb marked by a single slab lies near the more magnificent one of Sixtus
            IV. Then we went to the Colonna Gallery, and looked at the few best pictures, among them
            that splendid portrait of an unknown by Paul Veronese - a study in green. Another
            morning Nettie and I, Howard and Mr. B. had a perfect morning among the pictures at the
            Vatican, and then went on to the Doria, which we found closed for the week of
            festivities, so we went rumbling home. In the afternoon we all went to the Villa
            Borghese to see the Borghese collection transferred to the Villa from the Palazzo - and
            again it was a great pleasure to see through eyes more knowing and discriminating than
            ours. We met Mrs. Ledyard there, whom we had missed in mutual visits. Mr. Berensen went
            back to Florence tonight. We have seen a great deal of a brother of Fieldings, who is in
            a Seminary here, being educated as a priest, Basil Fielding - quite unlike his brother
            in looks and character. He too is charming - a big, pink and white young fellow, as full
            of fun as can be. Hotel de la Grande - Bretagne. Florence. April 20. The ride from Rome
            this morning was delicious. I have never seen Italy before in such entire spring
            costume. The whole country is bitterly in need of rain, and crops will be a serious
            failure if it does not come soon. Mr. Fielding had engaged rooms for us at the New York
            Hotel, having left Rome 3 days before we did. He had tried Page 129 for the rooms we
            wanted at every other hotel, without success. But when we saw them we were so disgusted,
            we were in dismay; and Theodore so tired and ill that he seemed to be quite helpless. So
            I begged him to let me try to find others and he consented, though he felt it hopeless.
            So, I took Howard, and getting into a cab, we came here, and found our present
            delightful appartment had just been vacated; so we went immediately back to report and
            by 5 o’clock were comfortably settled here. I have a sweet, cheerful little yellow room,
            opening off the salon, with 2 big sunny windows, and we all look out upon the river and
            although the Lung Arno is always noisy, it is always bright and charming. We are between
            the Ponte Vecchio and the Trinita with the picturesque line of opposite houses across
            the river, which everybody knows - and the mellow church bells clang from San Spirito
            church near, and the lights at night quiver on the river - and just now the new moon
            adds her pretty crescent to the scene. April 21. Mr. Berenson turned up according to
            appointment this morning, and we went first to Santa Maria Novella, and walking over its
            pavement of tombstones, their reliefs worn almost smooth, went to the Cappela Brancacci,
            at the end of the right transept to see the Madonna long famous as a production of
            Cimabue’s genius - but now denied as his as well as the pretty story of its loving
            welcome to Florence. Then to the chapel of the Strozzi, the frescoes of which by
            Fillippino Lippi of the story of the lives of S.S. Peter and John, have been sadly Page
            130 retouched and restored. In the chapel of the choir, we sat and looked at the
            frescoes of Ghirlandajo - and in another chapel, at those of heaven and hell by Orcagna
            (Andrea) where it was plain to see Michel Angelo got his inspiration. Then we went
            through the cloisters, and Spanish Chapel. Then Mr. Berenson took us to the Palazzo
            Martelli to see a lovely bust of St. John the Baptist - and a statue of the same and the
            beautiful and spirited coat of arms of the Martelli family - all by Donatello. In the
            afternoon Nettie and I drove out to San Miniato with Theodore and Nettie was in raptures
            over it - the first thing of the kind she had seen. The old niello pavement, and the
            quaint marble work of the screen, are so good. Just after we got home, Mr. Fielding with
            his mother Lady Denbigh came to see us - she a tall, sweet, sad faced woman, in deep
            black - with a charming voice. Fielding and his sister Lady Clare paid us a visit last
            evening. Mr. Berenson came to dine and a note from Mrs. Berenson asking us to dine the
            next evening. April 22. We started out with Mr. Berenson at 10 o’clock this morning, and
            went to Santa Croce and looked at the frescoes - especially those of Giotto in the
            Capella Peruzzi. Among those splendid tombs none are sosstriking [sic; so striking] and
            beautiful as that of Marsuppini by Desidero de Lettiguano. Afterwards we went to the
            cloisters, and the little Pazzi chapel then to the Duomo, where we paused long before
            the beautiful gates in bronze by Luca della Robbia, at the entrance to the sacristy
            Nuova. Page 131 Then we crossed to the Baptistry, and then home. In the afternoon
            Theodore and I took a long drive in the Cascine - and going quite to the end, we got out
            and walked through the quiet, deserted avenues. Then home in time for dressing, and
            driving out to the Berenson’s who occupy a beautiful appartment on the Cascine square.
            We met only Mrs. Baldwin, and Sir John Wood, a rather dull affair. Came home in time to
            drive through the streets, and see the illumination in honour of the Royal Silver
            Wedding. April 23. A morning in the Pitti with Mr. Berenson when we saw the pictures
            with larger, other eyes than our own. In the afternoon rest, and Fielding and his sister
            Lady Clare to dinner. Dr. Baldwin called. April 24. To the Uffizi this morning - and a
            delightful two hours with the pictures - coming home more dead than alive, with fatigue.
            Mr. Berenson stopped to lunch. Howard, Theodore and I went out in the afternoon but
            could not do much, as a heavy shower came up. Theodore went to see Lady Denbigh. Nettie
            in the house with a bad throat. Dr. Baldwin again. He has been taking a general look
            over Theodore, who feels much better. A mild epidemic of influenza prevails here. Page
            132 April 25th. To the Belli-Arti this morning, where we met Lady Denbigh and Fielding
            and after an hour, spent principally with the Boticelli’s Mr. Berenson had told us that
            the three Archangels with the young Tobias, was not a Boticelli - so we looked at it
            critically, half resenting the disallusion. It certainly lacks Boticelli’s colour but
            the spirit and action of the figures, seem certainly his. In the afternoon Theodore took
            Lady Denbigh for the drive over the hills to the restored castle of the Englishman, Mr.
            Temple Leader - and Mrs. Davis, Howard and I went over the same road half an hour in
            advance of them. The castle struck me as being very melodramatic - but the views were
            lovely. April 26th. Theodore and I went this morning to see the collection at the
            Bordini Palace - a great many curious and delightful things - especially in marble of
            exquisite Italian decoration. Theodore fancies immensely a piece of tapestry, which he
            thinks will go in the large space of the upper hall - but I am quite sure it is too
            large. In the afternoon he took Lady Clare to drive, and Nettie being unfortunately
            still condemned to the house with her bad throat, Howard and I went to La Badia and San
            Lorenzo - and failed getting in to the beautiful Or San Michele. Theodore went to dine
            with Lady Denbigh. We declined but Howard Nettie and I went up in a closed carriage in
            the evening and paid a visit. They are living in pension but having Page 133 a charming
            sitting room, radiant with flowers. Lady Denbigh has a sweet, motherly air, that is very
            taking - Lady Herbert of Lea, a great friend of theirs was there - quite the English
            novel dowager - who made herself very agreeable. Fielding had spoken of her as an
            “archbishop in petticoats”. We all arranged to go to the Bardini palace tomorrow
            morning. The night air is warm and delicious from the rain of today. April 27. To the
            Bardini this morning - Lady Herbert came to go with us. She bemoaned all the time the
            things she saw that had once belonged to churches and convents - and I am sure she found
            some of Theodore’s remarks quite horrifying. Theodore took the tapestry. Came home in
            the rain. In the afternoon Theodore, Howard and I drove to the Cascine - they got out to
            walk, while I drove round and round. Everything dripping with moisture, and the shaded
            avenues fairly black so dark was the afternoon. A thousand sweet scents in the air - we
            asked the Bronsons to dine tonight, but Mrs. B. had a bad cold and could not come. April
            28. Howard and I went to the Opera del Duomo - and then did a little shopping. It rained
            all day. In the afternoon we went to tea at Mrs. Bronsons, taking Mr. Fielding with us.
            It poured with rain while we were there - met two or three pleasant people. Fielding and
            Page 134 Lady Clare came to dinner - and Dr. Baldwin came in to say goodbye. April 30.
            4th Sunday after Easter. Venice. Grand Hotel. After a hurried morning yesterday, spent
            in seeing as much as we could of beloved Florence, we left at 2:30 - reaching here at 10
            P.M. The ride was charming, in the midst of so much luxurious spring vegetation. The
            vineyards so pretty, with the vines suspended from tree to tree - the young leaves well
            grown, making garlands from one end to the other. The entrance to Venice most opportune,
            on a cloudless night with a full moon - over which Nettie and Howard were in raptures.
            We have big rooms on the 3d floor of this big house - Nettie and I together occupy one
            vast appartment - our little beds miles apart - and our balcony overhangs the Grand
            Canal. This morning we went of course immediately to the Piazza San Marco - and then to
            the church - and afterwards along the Grand Canal - and again in the afternoon we went
            roaming in gondolas, in that delightful fashion common to Venice. The first time I saw
            Venice it was wrapped in snow, the next, it was drenched in rain. Now it is quite
            perfect - a bright sun by day, and a radiant moon by night. The little bits of garden
            that show over the walls or through open portals, or great iron gates, make such perfect
            little touches. May 1st. We all went down to the Piazza San Marco this morning, and
            wandered Page 135 about, before we went into the church. A magnificent funeral cortège
            appeared at the further end of the square; and the rich robes of the priests, the banner
            and canopies, the array of candles, the brilliant colours, made it like some of the old
            paintings one sees of the piazza. It made a great spectacle too in the church, and
            especially from the galleries, where we went. Mrs. Davis and Howard grew tired and went
            away - while Theodore, Nettie and I lingered over every detail - fairly caressing some
            of those mellow and time worn ornamental surfaces. There have been many restorations -
            chiefly in the pavement - which look questionable - however necessary they might have
            been. Their exact level and accurate outlines seem so inartistic, in comparison with the
            rich old marbles and irregular surfaces. The strange undulating surface of the pavement
            with its beautiful Alexandrian work is always such a delightful feature. We then went to
            the church of San Salvatore, where is an Annunciation by Titian painted in his 89th year
            - angels and clouds above, the Madonna with a look of glad surprise, and the Angel of
            Annunciation to the left, with the rush of descent still in his bearing - a grand thing
            - but little light to see it by. From there we went to S. Giovanni Crisostomo, where is
            a great picture of Giovanni Bellini of S.S. Jerome, Cristopher and Augustine finished in
            1513, in his 87th year, it had all Bellini’s beauty of colour, and a most sweet
            religious sentiment. In the same church is a painting above the high altar of Sebastian
            del Piombo of SS Crisostom, John, Augustine, Liberali, Catherine, Agnes and Magdalen.
            The faces of the women and the colouring fine - painted under the influence of
            Giorgione. Page 136 In the afternoon, Nettie and I went to the S. Zacharia, a church not
            far from the Riva dei Schiavoni - with a beautiful renaissance façade, and a madonna
            enthroned with four saints by Giovanni Bellini - and the nativity of John the Baptist by
            Tintoretto over the door of the sacristy. The charm of going about Venice, threading
            one’s way through one little canal after another, with charms and surprises at every
            turn - then, perhaps stopping at a little flight of steps, as we did at S. Zaccaria,
            walking through an arch, or a narrow calle or alley, into a quiet little campo, is truly
            enchanting. But it takes time to get about in this way, and after we had gone to S.
            Maria Formosa to see Palma Vecchio’s magnificent Barbara, it was time to come home. May
            2d. Theodore, Nettie and I put in the whole morning at the Academia, and came home to
            lunch in a limp condition. Mr. Berenson had marked our books for us, telling us what was
            most worth seeing, which was a great boon, as our time is so short. We first looked at a
            Madonna and child by Giov. Bellini - and another Madonna with St. Catherine and a
            Magdalen; remarkable for the beauty in the faces of the women. And still another Madonna
            with S.S. Paul and George - and another Madonna enthroned with SS. Francis, Job, John,
            Sebastian, Dominic and Louis, with 3 angels on the steps of the throne, playing on
            instruments - a lovely composition - Then, at some pictures by Cima da Conegliano, an
            artist about whom I was wofully ignorant - a Madonna with John the Baptist, and St. Paul
            - another Madonna with Page 137 saints - and the angel Raphael with Tobias between the
            Baptist and St. Nicholas. An exquisite painting of the Madonna and Saints by Boccacino
            da Cremona. Naval battle with saints in the clouds and a Madonna and Saints by Paola
            Veronese. The Presenation in the temple by Titian, a gorgeous mass of lovely color - his
            St. John in the Wilderness - his Entombment, painted in his 99th year it is said, and
            which indeed he left unfinished - and his wonderful assumption, which seems to me a far
            greater work than Raphael’s Transfiguration. Fishermen presenting the Doge with the ring
            received from St. Mark, by Paris Bordone. Banquet of Dives [sic; Divas] - Massacre of
            the Innocents, Solomon’s Judgement, by Bonifacio. Madonna and child and four senators -
            Death of Abel - Two Senators and St. Mark releasing a condemned slave, by Tintoretto.
            Cure of a Lunatic, with the Rialto bridge in the background - colour- perspective -
            architectural effects, and quaint detail. Presentation in the Temple - and the nine
            scenes from the fascinating legend of St. Ursula, painted for the school of that name in
            Venice, charmingly quaint and interesting by Carpaccio. Peter enthroned with other
            saints and the Assumption by Ralma Vecchio. The St. George of A. Mantegna, a small
            picture and very exquisite. Five delightful little cabinet pictures, Allegories, by
            Giov. Bellini - and the very interesting large picture of Gentile Bellini’s. The finding
            of a portion of the true Cross - and The Procession in the Piazza of St. Marks - from
            its minute detail, it shows the changes which have taken place since 1496, when the
            picture was painted. In the afternoon we went to the Church of the Madonna del Orto,
            where is a picture Page 138 of St. John the Baptist, with St. Peter, Mark, Jerome and
            Paul by Cima da Conegliano - and Tintoretto’s Last Judgement, and Adoration of the
            Golden Calf, and Presentation in the Temple. Then we went to S. Maria dei Miracoli, a
            beautiful, small, early Renaissance church, with fine marbles and good decorations,
            where the most interesting thing was the old Sacristan who was so in love with his
            church and all his things, and so eager to show us the few little treasures it
            possessed, that he took us into the damp, dark little sacristy, and pulled out various
            drawers, to show us some poor and much worn ceremonial vestments. I wondered what he
            would have said to the beautiful one hidden away in my trunk! Nettie and I then went to
            S. Giovanni in Bragora, where is a beautiful Baptism of Christ by Cima da Conegliano
            lovely light - colour - water - distance. Two Saints by the same - and a Resurrection by
            L. Vivarini - very fine - two upturned faces of angels. Then we went to that little gem
            of a church, S. Giorgio degli Schiavoni, a small renaissance church, with the well known
            pictures of Vittoria Carpaccio of the legends of St. George and St. Jerome - about which
            Ruskin has written such pleasant nonsense in his “Shrine of the Slaves”. These pictures
            have all Carpaccio’s soft colour, and good painting, and crude conceits. And the little
            square church, hardly larger than an ordinary sitting room, wainscoted with dark wood to
            the level on the narrow pictures, with the dark, low, ribbed ceiling, the beams gilded -
            and the two broad windows with their red curtains, with the sun shining brightly in,
            made such a cheerful interior, that we said we felt like having afternoon tea there, and
            bringing our work! Page 139 and books. Up the short flight of stairs into the second
            church or oratory, where the ceiling was still lower, and painted by Palma Vecchio and
            there were more low windows, with the sun streaming brightly in, the effect was even
            more domestic. May 3rd. We said so much about the little S. Giorgio Church when we went
            home, that Theodore was moved to go himself and he and I and Annie went this morning,
            and I was even more charmed. Afterwards Theodore, Nettie and I went to S. Maria della
            Salute and saw in the sacristy, and saw Titian’s St. Mark and four Saints - and his Cain
            and Abel, Abraham and Isaac, David and Goliath. The day was cloudy, and the light very
            bad. Tolerable light on Tintoretto’s splendid Marriage of Cana. Then we went into the
            Seminaris Patriarcale, and saw a small collection of pictures - among them Giogioni’s
            Apollo and Daphne. The building was interesting. May 4th. Theodore, Nettie and I went on
            a delightful little excursion this afternoon. Mr. Berenson had given Theodore a card of
            introduction to a Count Nardi - living at Mira, some distance from Venice - who had some
            good pictures, one of which he thought Theodore could buy. We took an interpreter, as we
            had been told none of these people could speak French or English. We had an early lunch,
            and got into a clean little steamer that carried us in half an hour to Fusana, where we
            took Page 140 a little steam train, several miles to Mira. We found the house but a
            short distance from the station. Such extraordinary little monstrosities ornamented each
            side of the short avenue leading to the house, standing on pedestals two feet high,
            themselves hardly higher, short, misshapen grotesques of men and women, once evidently
            highly coloured. The Count Nardi, was not at home, but we were asked in by a nice old
            crone - and found most of the house empty, and at our service. There were quantities of
            pictures in the broad hall, that led straight through the house, above and below - one
            or two bearing the name Tiziano, and other talismanic names. But the special picture we
            wanted to see was in the bedroom of a guest who was taking his siesta - and the old
            servant who talked loud enough at other times, lowered her voice so respectfully when
            she spoke of it, that we knew him to be an honoured guest, and not to be disturbed for
            curious Americans - and as the picture was valued at a fabulous price, by its owner, we
            were not desolated but gave a franc to the old woman, and came away. Outside the gate we
            found the little carriage and its good natured looking driver, whom we had declined at
            the railway station, patiently waiting for his prey, and having three hours or more on
            our hands before we could take the train back to Venice, decided that we would drive on
            to Dolo. The afternoon was quite perfect, warm and bright - the whole country fresh from
            last nights rain, in perfect spring beauty - the larks were singing - fields bright with
            flowers - the poppies showing their brilliant heads among the corn - the ditches by the
            roadside full of water lilies, and tall yellow irises - and the smooth level little Page
            141 road led along the bank of the little river Brenta which is really a canal, and past
            country houses on either side of the river, more or less grand, with beautiful
            shrubberies and quaint Italian gardens - and one succeeded another like pictures in a
            dream, until we came to the great walls of an immense park, which we were told was a
            Royal park or palace, once the property of the Pisani family - now a National Museum. It
            is called Stra. We were told we could go in, and we drove through the great gateway, and
            get out of the carriage at the grand portal, where if it had not been for the guard, and
            an old paralytic sitting in an easy chair, we might have supposed we had reached the
            Enchanted palace. We saw no one else - and up the very grand staircase we went, and
            through room after room - reception rooms - bedrooms - great ball rooms and salons and
            stately corridors - all deserted, but ready, until I half expected to come upon the
            Sleeping Beauty. Rooms once occupied by Victor Emmanuel, in one of which he signed the
            armistice between Italy and Austria. Others in which the great Napoleon lived - his
            bedroom quite magnificent - the big bed all gold and white satin with a big N at the top
            - even the mattresses covered with rich white silk. From every window, lovely glimpses
            of the grounds and trees, down to which we afterwards went, and walked through one or
            two of the stately avenues, and took a peep into the ornamental gardens, which had
            vanishing lines of great orange trees in huge ornamental pots - and geometrical bed of
            flowers - and stretches of glass - and miles of walled fruits. The part itself seemed a
            paradise, with its stretches of wide lawns and stately trees. Then feeling hungry, we
            drove into the quaint little Page 142 town, and into the courtyard of a clean little
            Osteria, and entered the principal room, low and long, with one end devoted to the
            kitchen, with its simple stone range and its bright array of copper pans and pots. Over
            the little fire burning at the end of a large bunch of faggots a woman was roasting
            coffee in a simple and effective way. A large iron ball with a long handle, which she
            twirled constantly. We had an excellent colazione, bread, cheese, butter and a delicious
            native wine, all for 2 and a half francs. While we were eating it, three men came in and
            ordered supper - and we saw Father, Mother and daughter cooking it. The walls of the
            room were decorated with coloured prints - and a shrine before which burned a lamp - and
            curious little mottoes, framed and hung about, some of which I copied. Vinci amico mio,
            A fa credenza Mangia, beve e godi E un errora Ma non piantar Si perde el Denaro Di
            chiadi E la ventore. La luna senza sol Non resplendi Il vin senza dinar Non si vendi.
            Afterwards we had a drive of 3 miles to the station, and were home again by 7 o’clock.
            After dinner went to call on the Farrers. Old Sir William looking aged and feeble - the
            two girls in deep black for their mother - very nice girls. We are off tomorrow for
            Milan, early. We have had perfect weather during our stay - and resplendent moonlight
            Page 143 nights. The grand Canal in front of the hotel has been filled every evening
            with gondolas - and much music. We have been out on the water almost every evening - and
            what more delicious than to lie in a gondola with those perfect surroundings and listen
            to the dip of the oars in the silvered waters! Milan. 6 May. Hotel Cavour. Such a
            charming journey from Venice yesterday through the rich green country and past
            picturesque towns, arriving at this very pleasant and comfortable hotel, where, in our
            pleasant sitting room, we found a sumptuous lunch waiting for us. Later we went out to
            see the Cathedral and to take a drive; but the really hot morning had changed - the
            clouds were big and black, and the wind blowing in such gusts that after leaving the
            Cathedral and trying a short drive, we gave it up and walked in the Arcade. Mr. Fielding
            arrived from Florence in the evening. This morning soon after breakfast we all, except
            Mrs. Davis, armed ourselves with our guide books and glasses, and went to the Brera,
            where we spent two hours looking only at the pictures Mr. Berenson had marked for us,
            and which formed the cream of the whole gallery. We saw the Madonna enthroned with
            angels and saints by Bart. Montagna - then Gentile Bellini’s Preaching of St. Mark at
            Alexandria. Piero della Francesca’s Madonna and Saints with Duke Federigo Montefeltro.
            C.Crivelli’s Christ on the Cross - Madonna and Saints - Madonna and Child - the latter
            most charming in its Pgae 144 beautiful coloring and quaint accessories - Giov.
            Bellini’s Madonna - the Madonna with the Greek inscription - and a Pieta - the last most
            tender and impassioned - the Madonna holding the Christ in her arms, and pressing her
            face to his - you can feel the tender support of her arms, and the suffering sympathy of
            her glance, as she gazes into the pale face - the tones of the picture sad and subdued -
            the pale sky with flat lines of cloud. Bonifazio, the Elder’s Finding of Moses in the
            Bulrushes - a lovely thing in colour and figures. Paola Veronese’s SS. Anthony, Abbas,
            Cornelius and Cyprian. Mantegna’s Pieta, the Madonna in a nimbus of angels heads. Saints
            by Cima da Conagliano. Three superb portraits by Lorenzo Lotto and the famous Sposalizio
            of Raphael - one of the sweetest and saintliest pictures in the world. Then we went to
            the Museo Poldi-Pezzoli - the collection house, bric-a-brac, furniture, pictures in most
            charming taste, made up of most precious and valuable things, and given by the owner at
            his death to the town. A sweet Boticelli - Christ and St. Francis by Crivelli. Ecco Homo
            by A. Solario, and Flight into Egypt - and the exquisite portrait of a lady generally
            attributed to Piero della Francesca but which Mr. Berenson says is not his. In the
            afternoon Nettie Howard and I, with Jones rushed off directly after luncheon to see the
            churches of S. Ambrosio, S. Maria presso S. Celso, at the last we saw a lovely
            Bergognone, Madonna and Child, with St. John the Baptist - and a sweet Sassoferato.
            Nettie taking Jones, then went to look for photographs, and to the roof of the Cathedral
            - while Theodore and I, Howard and Annie started in 2 carriages for the drive to Monza
            the Royal Park Page 145 which was very beautiful after we reached it, but the drive to
            which was long, dull and commonplace - the cold wind driving the dust in our eyes and
            ears - we were glad enough to get indoors again. We leave early tomorrow for Luserne.
            Lucerne. 8 May. Hotel National. Left Milan Sunday morning - and had a beautiful day
            crossing that wonderful St. Gotthard pass, until we got well on the other side, where we
            found clouds and mist - and Lucerne quite damp and wet from recent rain. I have never
            before been to this hotel - and think it more delightful than the Schweizerhof - which I
            know so well. It is just on the border of the Lake, and very quiet, and a most excellent
            house. Our big sitting room and bed rooms look out on the Lake and we have had a fire
            both today and last evening. We walked this morning to see the Great Lion of Thorwaldean
            - and to the old bridges - visited our friend the antiquarian Bossard - and after lunch
            Nettie, Howard and I poked about among the shops, they being quite new to the charms of
            carved wood ornaments, and other Swiss fantacies which become after a visit or two, so
            hateful. Then we had an organ concert at the Cathedral and Nettie and I walked about
            that cheerful little burying ground. All day the clouds have hung low, and the mists
            have obscured the mountains and the cold wind has blown. We will spend tomorrow night at
            Basle, en route to Paris. Page 146 Paris - 14 May. Hotel Westminster. Sunday after
            Ascension. We left Lucerne on the afternoon of the 9th. After breakfast that morning
            Theodore and Fielding went for a long tramp - the rest of us took 2 carriages and went
            first to my old haunt the “Drei Linden”, where I used to go and walk with Annie and Col.
            Frendenberg and the Collins - but now how changed! Ever since the last time we were
            there 5 years ago, with Charlie and Nellie Wilson it is very changed. The pleasant climb
            up the steep meadows, and the walk along the edge of the hill, with the three great
            Lindens standing there. These are now the only things to mark the spot - roads having
            been cut, lots laid off, and staring new villas built - so we turned away disgusted and
            went to drive through the lovely blossoming country. The meadows all about Lucerne are
            filled with the most graceful trees - they are like well kept parks - the ground was
            brilliant with flowers and the quaint Swiss houses, with their gardens and Archives,
            delighted Nettie. We got home just in time for lunch, and were off immediately after to
            the station - reached Basle after a lovely ride at 5 o’clock - and walked about awhile
            before dinner. The Trois Rois where we stopped looked very familiar. the next morning we
            left at 9 o’clock for Paris - that long ride seemed less tiresome than usual - we had a
            comfortable compartment, and the country was in such full spring beauty. We went to the
            Chatham - but did not like our rooms, and came here, where we have a charming appartment
            quite to ourselves - and every thing most convenient and luxurious. We plunged of course
            at once into the vortex of shopping, and it seems just Page 147 now as if we would never
            be able to extricate ourselves. This morning was so fresh and warm, that Theodore
            proposed that Nettie, I and Mr. Fielding should drive with him to the Bois, and have
            lunch there - which we did after having spent an hour or so at the Louvre. We drove to
            the Café du Pavillion, where we had a delicious lunch under the trees, with an Hungarian
            band playing near. We afterwards drove about the park, which was filled with people and
            carriages hurrying to the Longchamps races. There were too many people, in fact. Yet it
            is always pleasant to see the natural naive way in which the french enjoy themselves -
            such numbers everywhere - sitting or lying about on the grass, or sitting in chairs - or
            walking. Mothers, nurses, babies, fathers with newspapers and books - or playing games -
            all manners of simple innocent enjoyments. May 24. We are quite ready to leave for
            London tomorrow. Our fortnight here has been a very busy one - and out of it we have
            lost 4 working days - that is 2 Sundays and 2 fête days - and we have been on a rush all
            the time. It has rained much of the time. Last Saturday we went out to Fontainbleau
            returning on Monday morning. It rained most of the time we were there - though we did
            manage a drive through the superb beech forests on Sunday morning. Page 148 London. 28
            May. Trinity Sunday. Albemarle Hotel. Piccadilly. We crossed last Thursday from Boulogne
            to Folkestone on a beautiful day - and arrived here at 7 P.M. A comfortable hotel,
            though not as good as Longs or the Bristol. The weather is good - too good for the
            welfare of the country - for everywhere the fields are drying up - and the crops looking
            very thin and starved. This morning Nettie, Theodore and I went down to St. Pauls - but
            found a long ordination service going on, and after hearing a little most beautiful
            music, we came out, and walked about the streets coming upon a quaint little church,
            into which we went, and found a delightful service just beginning. The church was that
            of St. Nicholas Cole - Abbey - a small square renaissance structure, with curious
            tablets and memorial stones upon the walls. The choir screen was very good - and it was
            beautifully decorated with vines, red cannas, and pink and white cyclamens. The organ
            was splendidly played, but was a little too big for the church - much beautiful music
            was sung - Gounod’s Messe, among other things - and the choir composed about a third of
            the congregation. May 29. We went by appointment this morning to Westminster Abbey and
            met Mary Parsons, and Mr. and Mrs. Cheston, and Mrs. Messer, a cousin of Marys, and
            daughter of our old Bishop McIllvaine of Ohio. I used to know her long, long ago as
            Naine McIllvaine. She married an Englishman years ago, who was no good - with not even a
            good social position - Page 149 she has been a widow for some years with 2 girls and a
            boy. She is very familiar with the Abbey and all its dignitaries and acted as our guide.
            We went before we came away into the Triforium - and we also saw the extraordinary wax
            effigies, which have not until lately been shown to the public. Queen Elizabeth, Charles
            II, William III and Mary, Queen Anne, William Pitt, Earl of Chatham and Lord Wilson -
            remarkable things - clothed with the clothes worn in life, and were used in the funerals
            of those buried in the Abbey. Coming away very late we saw the Prince of Wales and his
            suite going in gorgeous state carriages to hold a levee at St. James Palace. In the
            afternoon we went to leave cards on the Lidderdales, Rathbones, and Miss Lüling. It
            poured with rain all the time. June 1st. Shopping and sightseeing are keeping us busy.
            Last evening Theodore, Nettie and I went to the opera, and heard the new play Pagliacci,
            with which we were greatly disappointed. I had never seen Convent [sic; Covent] Garden
            Opera House before, and in spite of all I had heard in its disfavor I was amazed at its
            ugliness, bareness and discomfort. I spent one afternoon at the National Gallery - the
            most delightful gallery in the world - so many great masterpieces and no trash - the
            different rooms so well arranged, and comfortable seats about everywhere. We spent our
            time in the two rooms devoted to Dutch art - and what a beautiful art it is! We have
            seen several of the attractive art stores - and this morning we went early to Christies
            Page 150 to see the Baring sale of pictures - a great crowd - and the street thronged
            with carriages. June 3. Theodore and I went this morning to William Morris’ place in
            Oxford St. to look at rugs and stuffs. We found enchanting things of all kinds - a
            beautiful rug amongst them, which Theodore will take I think, for the dining room. Last
            evening Gaspard Farrer dined with us. Tomorrow, Theodore, Nettie and I are going down in
            the country to Hothorpe, the place of the de Traffords - Lady Agness de Trafford is
            Fieldings sister - and this afternoon we all went by invitation from Lord Denbigh to the
            House of Lords. He was waiting for us at the entrance and most kindly and good naturedly
            took us about everywhere. It was immensely interesting - as some skirmishing was going
            on, on the Irish question - it was thought that Lord Salisbury would speak - but he
            didn’t. The Conservative benches were very full - but those of the Liberal Unionists
            were almost empty. Lord Zetland, a conservative, opened the debate, and was followed by
            Earl Spencer on the other side, who made an awkward hesitating attempt for a weak cause.
            We had to come away just after Lord Waterford began in a clear and forcible way to
            demolish Lord Spencer - I was sorry to come away, but we had to dine with the
            Lidderdales who live at Kensington. Yesterday for the first time we met Lord Denbigh.
            Lady Denbigh called soon after we arrived, and had written asking us to tea in the
            afternoon. We found her quite charming, and Lord Denbigh very nice in his own way, but
            very Page 151 different from Fielding. Their house, 2 Cromwell Houses, is all in
            disorder and filled with work people. They are awfully hard up, poor things, and this
            house as well as Newnham Paddox is for rent. We stopped on the way with Fielding at the
            Brompton Oratory - and heard some beautiful music - the large church crowded with a very
            good looking congregation. Hothorpe Hall. Theddingworth - Rugby. June 4. Sunday evening.
            Mrs. Davis with Howard and Fielding went yesterday morning to see the trooping of the
            Queen’s colours - they represented it quite a spectacle. Mr. and Lady Agnes de Trafford
            came to lunch, and at 4 o’clock, Nettie, Theodore and I met them at the Euston St.
            Station with Fielding, and we came out here, changing cars at Rugby, where we had time
            for a cup of tea. We got out at Theddingworth - a pretty little spot, and found a
            waggonette and servants with a little pony cart for the luggage, waiting for us. A short
            time along a lovely road with great trees and a thorn hedge, which Theodore and Fielding
            preferred walking, brought us to the gates, and another little drive to the house,
            comfortable and unpretentious, with grass terraces and chapel and conservatory,
            exquisite views over the park with it elms and oaks - we had big rooms, all chintz and
            comfort - and such charming views from the windows, the park lying in the evening light,
            the image of quiet peaceful beauty. A handsome dinner - flowers and gold service in a
            big dining room and music, and some rather slow conversa Page 152 tion in the evening -
            and at 11 o’clock Nettie and I gladly took our candle sticks and came up to our rooms;
            Theodore, Fielding and Mr. de Trafford at a game of billiards. This morning I could
            hardly dress myself for looking out of the windows, at the sheep lying in the shade of
            the trees, and the cattle in their paddocks browsing on the green green grass. After a
            delicious, substantial English breakfast, Lady Agnes took me to the chapel, built by Mr.
            de Trafford to the memory of a brother, and presently Mr. de Trafford and Fielding came
            in. The chapel was small - in the Romanesque style - in excellent taste, and all the
            details well executed, the stained glass especially good in design and colour - the
            altar very good, and the Confessional richly carved. These three young people took such
            pleasure in it, and showed such reverence. They made many excuses then, and went off to
            mass at the neighboring estate of Bosworths - and Theodore and I roamed about gazing at
            the scenery - and the great stretches of park lands - such superb trees - such softness
            and richness. Then Nettie joined us and I took them into the chapel, and then we walked
            down through the park as Mr. de Trafford had suggested, and crossed the little river,
            and out through the lodge gates into the public road, down to the village, where we
            found a typical English church and churchyard - gray with age and covered with ivy. We
            found an interesting interior - part of the church belonging to the Norman period - with
            quaint old font, and inlaid pulpit. The service had begun, and including ourselves there
            must have been 20 in the congregation. I should have liked staying after service and
            looking about, but the church was very cold and Page 153 damp and Theodore complaining
            of the chill, we contented ourselves with walking about the churchyard, and back to the
            Hall through the lanes in the warm still air, with the bees humming and the birds
            singing - Nettie was so charmed with the village and the cottages with their thatched
            roofs and bright flowers and their little front gardens and they are charming. The
            clouds were so threatening we hurried - but the storm did not burst until after luncheon
            when we were out seeing the stables - and we had to wait sometime there, as it hailed
            smartly - and left the air beautifully clear and cool. In the evening Nettie sang for
            us, and Fielding played, and I am writing my book up to date, writing very late. We said
            goodbye as well as goodnight to Mr. de Trafford as he goes away early in the morning to
            a cricket match. He is a great cricketer - and hunter. He has 7 hunters in loose boxes
            in his stables. He is the 2d son of Sir Humphrey de Trafford of Trafford Hall near
            Manchester - who gave him this estate of a 1000 acres 10 years ago, and he has lived
            here since and last autumn married Lady Agnes Fielding. They seem most frankly in love
            with each other and before their marriage, he built a sitting room with bedroom above
            for her - the sitting room with their initials turned in the woodwork. We leave tomorrow
            morning - going over to Newnham Paddox for lunch. London. 6 June. We left Hothorpe
            yesterday soon after breakfast, Lady Agnes and Mr. Fielding with us, in a waggonette
            with a pair of fine horses, and a big hamper, for a drive of 13 miles to Newnham Paddox,
            the Denbigh Page 154 estate. The scenery was delicious the tall hedges gay with dog
            roses like our wild roses, but taller and less compact in manner of growth. When we
            entered the park at Newnham, it was enchanting - splendid trees everywhere - the gates
            are quite magnificent and fine specimens of iron work - the house an enormous pile of
            brick with stone facings and a mansard roof - very ugly - a large chapel at one end, and
            what had been magnificent gardens on one side - terraced and geometrical with stretches
            of splendid shrubberies, the rhododendrons just off their prime. We entered the first
            floor with big dining room and library, really 3 rooms in one, the library with deep
            embrasured windows - bed rooms, reception rooms and billiard room, all full of beautiful
            and interesting things - and then to the next floor, where were the state dining room
            and drawing room with walls covered with family portraits and pictures - those in the
            drawing room mostly full length and built into the walls! There were 2 state bed rooms
            once occupied by Queen Adelaid with superb furniture and hangings in rose coloured
            brocade - ante rooms and sitting rooms, until one’s head was turned. The family
            portraits are interesting. The first Countess of Denbigh created in 1622 was Susan
            Villiers, sister of George Villiers, Duke of Buckingham - full length portrait of both
            of them by Van Dyke - and of the Duke of Hamilton and many others with strange
            histories, which Lady Agnes and Fielding rattled off to us most amusingly. There was a
            portrait of King James presented by himself - and a miniature of William 3d painted by
            the then Countess of Denbigh. The chapel was beautiful - quite a church - and there is a
            resident priest with a house in the grounds - and a Page 155 fine organ. Beautiful fresh
            flowers everywhere about - the church serves for the parish church - there is an
            entrance from the house, and from the second floor, a large balcony opens on the church.
            After we had seen the house, lunch was served in one of the down stairs rooms half
            sitting room and half library, and a very good one it was - a kind of a picnic - and we
            were very merry - though the sister and brother must have felt it very sad - their home
            no longer - the changed and dismantled house - for no one lives there now, and they hope
            to let it. Word had been sent to the housekeeper yesterday, that we would be there to
            lunch - the few servants about, so glad to see the members of the family. The late Earl
            though a lovely character was a fanatic - and parted with everything he could, to build
            a church and monastery in Wales, where he now lies buried. The church has a rather
            strange history. It was begun by the Earl and his first wife who were protestants. She
            soon died - he entered the Roman communion, and the church was diverted from protestant
            to Roman and finished as such. After luncheon we went again into the grounds - and into
            the garden, which is huge - a high wall about it, and the gardeners cottage within the
            walls. There was a great deal of glass - the grapery magnificent - but everything showed
            neglect and want of expenditure. But how lovely the grounds were - especially near the
            river - what superb trees! We went back to the house through what is called the grass
            avenue, a long beautiful avenue of beeches with a grass road between. In one of the
            rooms we saw drawings of Newnham in all its stages. It began very well and was very good
            looking, then it was enlarged and Page 156 changed to disadvantage - then the late Earl
            built the present ugly thing around the old house. A carriage arrived from Rugby early
            in the afternoon to take us to the station, and Theodore, Nettie and I said goodbye to
            Lady Agnes and Fielding who waved their adieux as long as we could see them - then we
            had a pleasant drive through Lutterworth to Rugby, took the train for London - and are
            once more in smoke and turmoil - and a wretched exchange it is for the lovely sylvan
            scenes we left behind us! 7 June. Theodore and Nettie have gone tonight to hear Mr. and
            Mrs. Kendal in a “Scrap of Paper”. This morning I went with Theodore to Christie’s to
            see pictures and a lot of lovely things - we intended to stay but a moment, but it was
            nearer 2 hours. Among them are two lovely little portraits of a prince and princess by
            P. Mignard, and 2 pictures of Aart Van der Neer, a river scene, and a Dutch Town on a
            River - and a lovely example of A. Van der Velder “A Calm”. Theodore intends bidding for
            these at the auction on the 10th. This afternoon Annie, Nettie, Howard and I went out to
            St. John’s Wood to have tea with Mrs. Messer - a dismal, commonplace little house, and
            two very commonplace daughters - a very clever son. June 8. This morning with Theodore
            and Fielding to the Dowdeswell Gallery to see some early English paintings. This
            afternoon Theodore Page 157 Nettie and I drove out to the Dulwich Gallery, to see the
            fine collection of Cuyps they have there - as we drove away from the hotel, met Eddie
            Lidderdale, and took him along. This evening Mr Fielding dined with us and we went to
            the Savoy theatre to hear the play of “Jane Annie”, written by Barrie and Conan Doyle,
            the music by Ernest Ford - and excessively weak, boring thing - utter bosh - house
            practically empty. We came home in hansoms. It is wonderful to see the jam and crush of
            the streets of London at night! June 9. Just home from a pleasant dinner in the bachelor
            appartments of the Farrar brothers - our whole pilgrimage went - and they had their
            married sister Mrs. Parker down from the country. A delightful fashion for 3 brothers to
            live in. The 3 dining room windows open on St. James Park and the drawing room windows
            nearly opposite the Carlton Club. A rather pleasant man by the name of Boyle took me in
            - he is cousin to the writer on gardening E.V.B., a woman. The other evening when we
            were dining at the Lidderdales, I went in with a Mr. Arbuthnot, who proved very
            agreeable - and some one happening to speak of John Inglesant, said that he knew
            Shorthouse - a small insignificant looking man, a screw maker by trade - and when
            Arbuthnot once said to him, having been much in Italy, that he, Shorthouse must know
            Italy and the Italians well, said he had never been there - that he knew of it, he got
            from the journals of his mother - who had travelled a good deal, and kept a faithful
            record of all she saw and heard - that after her Page 158 death these journals coming
            into his possession he began to write this story - that his MSS. lay for years in his
            desk, until one day his wife begged to read it, and then urged him to publish it! June
            10. Quite alone tonight; Annie, Nettie and Howard having gone to Oxford today to stay
            over Sunday, and take in Kenilworth and Stratford and Theodore having gone to Dorking to
            spend Sunday with the Rathbones - I had a very cordial note from Mrs. Rathbone, asking
            me to come too, but I thought it best to decline. This morning about 10 o’clock, Mr.
            Berenson appeared, and Theodore, M. [sic; N.] and I went off to the French Gallery to
            see a beautiful portrait of a Lady of Ferdinand Bol, which Theodore has just bought.
            Fielding and Mr. Berenson to lunch, and they and Theodore left immediately after for the
            auction at Christie’s. A great labor parade took place this afternoon. It came up St.
            James St. turned into Piccadilly on its way to Hyde Park. It began at 4:50 and about
            7:50 the rear end turned the corner. June 11. 2d Sunday after Trinity. Alone all day -
            and not out of the house - resting and writing. Jones just home after a visit of a few
            days to his people - bringing a new parlor-maid. He has just shown me a letter he
            received from Mohammed Salah from Cairo - he says the Golinischeffs had just arrived
            from up the river. It must have been warm enough by that time - though the papers report
            the cotton crop an almost entire failure in Egypt Page 159 because of the continued cold
            weather. June 12. I waited a long time for Theodore’s return from Dorking this A.M.
            finally Mr. Berenson came in - and after awhile Theodore appeared and we went off
            immediately to Agnews to see some pictures. In the afternoon Mr. Farrer came according
            to appointment and went with us to St. James Mall to hear Grossmith in a humourous
            recitation of how he discovered America! very amusing - but a little tiresome, the hall
            frightfully warm and close. June 13. My birthday! And I am 56 years old! Well, I cannot
            believe it! Mr. Farrer came in soon after breakfast to say goodbye, as he is off for a
            yachting tour - and then came his brother, afterwards the interesting, travelled, rather
            invalid brother - then Mr. Berenson and Nettie and I went off with him to the National
            Gallery to the early Italian and Tuscan rooms - and oh! what delightful treasures of art
            we saw! Fra Fillipo Lippi’s Madonna and Child - and his beautiful Annunciation painted
            for Cosimo de Medici, with his crest. S.S. John the Baptist, Francis, Lawrence, Cosmos,
            Damianus, Anthony and Peter the Martyr - also painted for Cosimo. Then Botticelli’s
            Adoration of the Magi, attributed to Filippino Lippi, son of Fillipo - Botticelli’s Mars
            and Venus - his lovely Nativity, with the dance of the angels among the clouds, and the
            angels embracing the saints below. Pollajuola’s Page 160 St. Sebastian, with wide
            landscape of the Val D’Arno. The death of Procris by Piero di Cosmio. Fra Angelico’s
            large and important picture, Christ with the banner of the Resurrection, with crowd of
            saints and Martyrs. Giov. Bellini’s Christ in Gethsemane. The warrior adoring the infant
            Jesus, attributed to Bellini, but painted by Cactena. A delicious picture of St. Jerome,
            reading, by Marco Basaite. Portrait of a man, by Andrea del Sarto - and the several
            splendid pictures by Moroni. Before these we sat and talked, and Mr. Berenson was very
            instructive and interesting. After two hours we came away well tired out. After lunch
            Theodore and I went shopping, came home at 5 o’clock for tea, and out again for a drive
            to the Park, where we spent some time walking about on the grass, among the superb oaks
            and beeches - the grass almost dead from the protracted drought. Theodore has gone
            tonight to dine at the Lidderdales to meet Mr. Bush and Blaird who are just arrived -
            they were here this morning, but I was out. The brought good news of Toby and home. June
            14. Theodore went out this morning with Mr. Rathbone, Nettie and Mr. Berenson to the
            National Gallery, and Howard went with me to several shops, then we drove out to the Row
            to see the riding, and sat under the big trees for an hour, then home to luncheon, Mr.
            Buk, Fielding and Berenson lunching with us. Nettie and Mr. Fielding went off then to
            see the restored church of St. Bartholomew, and St. Saviours in Surry [sic; Surrey], and
            for a lark on the tops of omnibuses, and came home late, in great glee, Page 161 dined
            early, and were off to the theatre. I went about after lunch, doing a lot of things, and
            then joined Theodore and Mr. Berenson at the National Gallery - then home for tea and
            muffins. Theodore, Annie, and I went to dine at the Amphitryon Club with Mr. Rathbone,
            and then to the Empire Theatre, where we had a box. It is a kind of glorified Café
            Chantant, and was hideously uninteresting - only redeemed by some trained French
            poodles, who did wonderful things. June 15. Mr Henry Farrar came this morning according
            to appointment, and went with me and Mr. Berenson to the National Gallery, to see the
            Italian pictures again, Mr. Farrar knowing Italian art very well, and being very fond of
            it, we had a charming morning. We pent a long time over the Memlings, this gallery
            possessing the largest and finest collection in the world. Mr Berenson came to lunch,
            Fielding also - and he and Theodore spent the afternoon together. I went off to do a
            little shopping - came home at 5 o’clock - for a cup of tea - and found them still
            talking. Then Theodore went off to call on Lord and Lady Denbigh - Nettie and Mr.
            Berenson came home after a delightful afternoon at the Abbey. It is our last evening in
            London - and we are in the last throes of packing, at which Jones has been busy all day.
            S.S. Furst Bismark. Tuesday, June 20th. We got away from London early Friday morning -
            Mr. Fielding Page 161 was at the station to see us off. Reached Southampton at 11
            o’clock and embarked immediately on the tender. The day was excessively hot, and we lay
            waiting for the Bismarck until 3 o’clock. Dreadful hours they were - when she at last
            came in, slowing up near us, she dropped her anchor, which getting beyond control for
            some reason, rushed out with fearful force and was lost. It created a great stir, and
            knocked the deck about the Capstain very much out of order. We were soon off - found our
            old deck rooms ready for us. We have about 90 first class passengers - a full 2d class -
            and a large 3d class as they take no more steerage passengers. I have never seen so
            vulgar and noisy a crowd of people. The weather has been good and favorable - have made
            splendid runs - and if we meet with no detention, should be in New York by Thursday
            night, or Friday morning. </body>
